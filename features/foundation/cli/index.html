<h1>CLI</h1>
<p>
  The CLI for Lore is intended to be a complimentary utility to the framework itself. As the CLI evolves, it will
  include the ability to write your own plugins for it, so you can extend or tailor its behavior.

<h3>Generators</h3>
<p>
  Generators are used to add common files (like components, actions, reducers) to your project, and include flags
  for generating those files in ES5, ES6 or ESNext style syntax. The generators can be especially useful when you
  need to override a default action or reducer.
