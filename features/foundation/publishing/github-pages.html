  <h1>Publishing to GitHub Pages</h1>
  <p>
    Instructions for publishing to [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com).
  </p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>
      At the moment, GitHub Pages is more complicated to publish to than Surge, so if you're not comfortable
      with Gulp or changing DNS settings to create a CNAME, it's recommended you don't use this approach until there
      is a more streamlined solution in place.
    </p>

  <h3>Video Demonstration</h3>
  <p>
    This will be added in the future.
  <p>

  <h3>Install the Gulp Task</h3>
  <p>
    To publish your project to GitHub Pages first install the gulp task to do so:
  <p>

{% highlight bash %}
lore generate github
{% endhighlight %}

  <p>
    This task will automatically install any dependencies and add them to the <code>devDependencies</code> in your
    <code>package.json</code>.
  </p>

  <h3>Publish Your Project</h3>
  <p>Next you'll need to run the gulp task to publish your project:</p>

{% highlight bash %}
gulp github
{% endhighlight %}

  <p>
    This task will build your project for production, create branch called <code>gh-pages</code>, and push your code
    into it.
  </p>
  <p>
    Once this completes your code will be available at <code>http://[username].github.io/[repository]</code>, where
    <code>username</code> is your GitHub username and <code>repository</code> is the name of your repository. For
    example, if your username was <code>fluffykittens</code> and you were creating an application called
    <code>furballs</code>, your application would be available at  <code>http://fluffykittens.github.io/furballs</code>.
  </p>

  <!--<h3>Publish Your Project to a User Repository</h3>-->
  <!--<p>-->
    <!--If you want to publish your project instead to a [user or organization webpage](https://help.github.com/articles/user-organization-and-project-pages/#user&#45;&#45;organization-pages),-->
    <!--like <code>http://fluffykittens.github.io</code> with no project extension (like /furballs) then you'll need to make-->
    <!--sure your repository is named  <code>[username].github.io</code>. When you publish, you'll also need to add an-->
    <!--argument for the branch to set it to <code>master</code>.-->
  <!--</p>-->

  <!--{% highlight bash %}-->
<!--gulp github &#45;&#45;branch=master-->
<!--{% endhighlight %}-->

  <h3>Why Can't I See My Application?</h3>
  <p>
    Once you publish, your application won't work on GitHub Pages because it doesn't get surged from the root of
    the domain. If you look at the <code>index.html</code> file at the root of your project, you'll see this script
    being loaded:
  </p>

{% highlight html %}
<script src="/dist/bundle.js"></script>
{% endhighlight %}

<p>
  This script pulls in your code, but the url expects the code to be located at
  <code>http://fluffykittens.github.io/dist/bundle.js</code>. But since your project is being served from
  <code>/furballs/</code>, and not <code>/</code>, you'll need to change this file to look like this:
</p>

{% highlight html %}
<script src="/furballs/dist/bundle.js"></script>
{% endhighlight %}

<p>
  With that in place, your code will load, but you'll still see a blank page. This is because the app is now being
  served from <code>/furballs/</code>, and React-Router doesn't know that. Your <code>routes.js</code> expects the
  application to be served from <code>/</code>:
</p>

{% highlight jsx %}
module.exports = (
  <Route component={Master}>
    <Route path="/" component={Layout} />
  </Route>
);
{% endhighlight %}

  <p>
    To fix that, you'll also need to change your <code>routes.js</code> file so that the root route is the repository
    of your application, like this:
  </p>

{% highlight jsx %}
module.exports = (
  <Route component={Master}>
    <Route path="/furballs/" component={Layout} />
  </Route>
);
{% endhighlight %}

  <p>With those changes in place, once you redploy, your application should work on GitHub Pages.</p>

  <h3>
    Non-Modification Option
  </h3>

  <p>
    If you don't want to modify your files to be served from <code>/furballs/</code>, your other option is to [create
    a custom domain](https://help.github.com/articles/using-a-custom-domain-with-github-pages/) so that your application
    can be served from <code>http://www.furballs.com</code>.
  </p>
  <p>
    If you want to go this approach and buy a custom domain, and don't already have a DNS provider (or want to switch
    from the one you currently have), I highly recommend [DNSimple](https://dnsimple.com).
