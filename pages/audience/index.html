# Why discuss the audience?
Why a framework or tool is created, and what problem it's trying to solve, is not always clear. But that motivation
has a huge influence on its future development, and knowing that up front can help inform your decision of whether
or not it's right for you.

If you've spent any time developing in Node.js for example, you may have stumbled upon the
[Node Frameworks website](http://nodeframework.com/), where there are literally dozens of libraries and frameworks
all competing for your attention. While the site is helpful in distilling them into categories, attempting to choose
one from within any single category is still an extremely non-trivial and time consuming task, that requires a large
investment of your time in order to find a tool with the "right fit".

This page is an attempt to shortcut that process, but clearly stating the motivations for building Lore, and how
those motivations are intended to manifest into value for people with different comfort levels in React-based
development.



### 1. React Beginners
If you're new to React, welcome; it's an amazing tool with a fantastic ecosystem.

* target: have never built a react app before

* value/what do I want to say:
- react is a great library, and an excellent foundation for your application
- can be a little challenging to build your first application with it (a lot to learn)
- lore makes it easy to get started
- built on patterns that will provide a solid foundation for your application
- NOT a "new way of building" React apps - simply conventions and recommendations about how to USE those libraries
to build applications that can easily adapt to change
- built on hugely popular technologies with a great ecosystem of support


### 2. In-betweeners
* target: people who are somewhat comfortable with React and Redux, and have some experience building apps

* value: what do I want to say
- if you've already created your first application, you know the process can be quite challenging, and full of lessons-learned.
- one of the most challenging areas can be integrating support for feature requests..features the initial architecture
  doesn't accomodate easily.
- Lore is architected to scale, and incldues built-in support for common feature needs like pagination, optimistic updates, and error handling
- lore also makes an effort to be transparent about the patterns it uses
- in addition to providing a powerful easy to use framework, lore's mission is to teach application architecture and explaining the reasons behind the patterns it uses is
- teaches the videos explaining the architecture


### 3. Super Comfortable with Redux
* target: people who have been build client-side applications for a while

* value: what do I want to say
- if you've been building applications for a while, you know supporting and growing an application
  is frought with challenges; consuming multiple APIs, unconventional APIs, inconsistent APIs, API versioning, quirky behaviors,
- all the functionality in lore is implemented as a series of plugins called hooks
- every part of lore can be overridden, which makes the framework extremely customizable


### 4. Non-Redux Devs
* target: client-side application developers, react or not
# value: what do I want to say
- lore is built around Redux, so framework doesn't have much direct value if you don't want to use Redux
- BUT it's making an effort to capture common concerns that a framework SHOULD solve for as
  examples and...
