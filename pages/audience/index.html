# Why discuss the audience?
Evaluating any framework or library can be a daunting task, especially when it’s not clear what problem (or set of
problems) that framework or library was really created to solve, let alone whether that set includes the problems
_you’re_ trying to solve for.

If you've spent any time developing in Node.js for example, you may have stumbled upon the
[Node Frameworks website](http://nodeframework.com/), where there are literally dozens of libraries and frameworks
all competing for your attention. And while the site is helpful for improving discoverability and distilling them into
categories, attempting to choose one from within any single category is still an incredibly non-trivial and time
consuming task, that requires a large personal investment of your time in order to find a tool with the "right fit".

This page is an attempt to shortcut that process, by clearly stating the motivations for building Lore, and how
those motivations are intended to manifest into value for people with different levels of comfort in React-based
development.



### 1. React Beginners
If you're new to React, welcome; it's an amazing library with a fantastic ecosystem. But as powerful, flexible, and
elegant as React is, it can also be [incredibly daunting to get started](/videos/building-your-first-react-app/). There
are a lot of libraries you need to learn to get started, and if it's your first time building a web application, it's
not going to be obvious how to connect those libraries into a solid, stable, and flexible architecture. That's where
Lore comes in.

Lore is a framework for building web applications, built on top of some of the most popular libraries in the React
ecosystem, such as Redux, React-Router and Webpack. Lore then applies a series of patterns and conventions on
top of those libraries that automatically solve for common application needs like API communication, pagination and
error handling (among others).

Lore has two core goals for React beginners;

1. The first is to provide a **safe environment** for you to become comfortable building React applications, by letting
you focus on learning React, and not getting bogged down by all the challenges associated with architecture.

2. The second goal is to **teach good architectural practices**. The patterns and conventions Lore uses come from years
of building diverse web applications, and in many cases incorporate the lessons learned from very costly mistakes.

So the value Lore provides to React beginners is that it makes it easy to get started, provides a safe environment to
learn React, and provides exposure to architectural patterns that have been proven to work for both small and large
applications alike.

Then, as you become more comfortable with React, and feel ready to dive in and learn more about the underlying libraries
and architectural patterns, you can check out the [architecture documentation](/architecture/) for an explanation and
demystification of the framework.


### 2. The In-Betweeners
This section is for people who are somewhat comfortable with React and Redux, and have some experience building web
applications.

If that's you, then you know application architecture can be quite challenging, and there are *a LOT of problems* you
have to solve for in a real application, many of which are not obvious up front. You may also know that Redux applications
can contain a lot of boilerplate.

Unfortunately, it can also be a little difficult to find discussion and examples about how to address these challenges
in real-world applications, especially since the code for most applications (that we could learn from) is kept in private
repositories.

Lore has two core goals for in-betweeners;

1. The first is to **demonstrate what's possible with Redux**. At it's core, Lore is not "some new way of developing
web apps". Lore **IS** Redux. But it was developed from the perspective of looking at every one of the dozen plus
applications I've built over the years, and asking the question _"Is there a set of patterns that can be applied to
Redux that can solve every problem across every application I've built over the years?"_. And once the answer became
clear the answer was _"yes"_, the followup was was _"Is there also a set of conventions can be applied to completely
eliminate the boilerplate, and place the entire development focus on React?"_. The result of those two questions is Lore.

2. The second goal is to **demonstrate a cohesive and holistic architecture** that is **able to solve for all common
application concerns**. The fact is, most web applications are incredibly similar with respect the problems the
application architecture needs to solve for; things like pagination, error handling, caching, and API communication.
The real differences (and the real value) like in the specific UI/UX concerns each application needs to solve for. But
too often we bogged down in the architecture, just *trying to get something to work*, and it takes away precious time
from creating a better product. Lore is intended as a proof of concept to demonstrate that most web applications
are not unique snowflakes; they're the exact same set of concerns, just dressed up in different clothes.

With people, it may be what's on the inside that matters the most. But with web apps, it's very much the opposite.
User's don't care about your architecture; they care about the features and user experience you provide, and how quickly
you can add new features to improve the value your product provides to them. Good architectures can be immense
enablers for rapid development, especially ones that solve for problems *you don't yet have but likely will* (needs
like cache invalidation or websocket integration to sync data across browsers in real-time).

So if you want to see what's possible with Redux, Lore might be of interest to you. And if you want to learn how it
all works, and about the reasoning behind the patterns Lore uses, you can check out the
[architecture documentation](/architecture/) for an explanation and demystification of the framework.


### 3. Super Comfortable with Redux
If you've been developing web applications for a while, and are already quite comfortable with Redux, you've probably
got your own set of libraries and patterns to solve the challenges Lore is built to address. And from that perspective
Lore probably doesn't provide as much value to you as it would to a developer just starting out; you've already got the
battle scars and learned the hard lessons that Lore is trying to help newer developers avoid.

But what might be useful is a comparison of the architectural patterns you've settled on with the ones Lore uses, to
see if any of those patterns are something you might want to adopt in your own Redux applications. Lore recognizes
that supporting and growing an application is fraught with challenges, some which only come later in development cycle;
challenges like consuming multiple APIs, unconventional APIs, inconsistent APIs, API versioning, and sometimes just
some really quirky behaviors and data flows.

The [architecture documentation](/architecture/) is intended to completely demystify how the framework works, by
explaining how it solves for each challenge, and talking directly to the underlying Redux patterns and reasoning behind
why the framework uses that approach.

Additionally, while Lore **is** a framework, and **does** express opinions about how to architect applications through
those, the framework itself is actually designed as one massive escape hatch. All the functionality in Lore is
implemented as a series of hooks (or plugins), and every part of lore can be overridden, which makes the framework
extremely customizable.

This means if you don't like the blueprints the framework uses for actions, you write your own hook and
replace the default behavior. Additionally, every hook has a configuration file that let's you overwrite or modify
it's behavior.

So if you do decide to try out Lore, you'll never be "locked in". If you know Redux, you know Lore. And if there's
something about your application that falls outside Lore's conventions and configuration options, you can easily
override or replace the framework's behavior to suite that specific need.



### 4. Non-Redux Developers
Lastly, for developers who don't want to use Redux, Lore has very little **direct value**. Redux is a central component
of the framework, and there's no getting away from it. Replacing it would require rewriting just about everything.

But the framework might provide some **indirect value** in it's effort to capture common application concerns that a
framework (or architecture) *should* solve for, as well as small examples that demonstrate and test each of those
concerns.

So if you're looking to build your own framework, or evaluating a non-Redux solution, it might be worthwhile to browse
through the examples and use cases Lore is solving as a way of comparing solutions or thinking through common
application concerns.
