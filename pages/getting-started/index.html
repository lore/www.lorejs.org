# Choose Your Own Adventure
The value proposition Lore provides varies a bit based on your comfort and experience building React applications,
and with web development in general.

To that end, we've grouped some helpful links below based on the experience level you identify with.


### 1. I'm new to React
Awesome! Welcome. You're about to embark on an amazing journey. To help give you some context about the value Lore
provides, and what problem it's trying to solve for, you might be interested in these links:

* [What's it like to build a React app without Lore?](/getting-started/building-your-first-react-app/)
* [How does Lore make the experience easier?](/getting-started/introduction-to-lore/)
* [Is there a tutorial suited for React beginners?](/quickstart/)


### 2. I've built one or more small React apps
Awesome! We should be friends. Since you already have some experience with React, you might enjoy these links to
help you contrast your previous development experience with Lore.

* [How does Lore improve the development experience for React applications?](/getting-started/introduction-to-lore/)
* [What features does Lore provide to help grow my application?](/features/)
* [Is there a tutorial suited for someone who's already built a React app before?](/quickstart/)


### 3. I've built or supported a large single page application
Awesome! We should grab coffee and swap stories, because truth be told, Lore is being built for you. These links
should give you some idea of how serious Lore is about supporting large applications, and what it's doing to try
and make your development experience more productive and fun.

* [What features does Lore provide to help grow my application?](/features/)
* [What happens when I have a problem that exceeds the limits of the framework?](/recipes/)
* Is there a tutorial suited for advanced React developers?
  * The quickstart does tackle some non-trivial challenges, but it'll take some time before it's built up to the point
of tackling things like performance optimizations, cache invalidation, custom actions/reducers, breaking API changes, etc.
