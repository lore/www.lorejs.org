# Config
An explanation of all config files, their options, and their role.

> This section is currently very empty, but will be filled in gradually as the related features of Lore are
> better supported and/or documented. In the meantime, each config file is somewhat self-documented, so feel free
> to explore and [file an issue](https://github.com/lore/lore/issues) if you have any questions.
