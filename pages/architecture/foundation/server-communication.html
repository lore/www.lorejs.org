# Server Communication
Useful for moving through a large set of data one page at a time. Core challenge is preventing action/reducer
explosion and being able to accommodate different API server conventions.

The video below is an excerpt from the full [Introduction to Lore](/audience/introduction-to-lore/)
video and provides a summary of the content on this page.

### Patterns That Lore is Built On
The video above talks about the interface Lore exposes for API communication, and how through conventions it can
eliminate the need to write actions and reducers for many endpoints. What the video doesn't explain is _how_ the
framework does this and what those patterns are.

A full explanation of this is not yet recorded, though it does exist in presentation form. Once it's recorded this
section will contain that explanation. In the meantime, if your curious, there is a short "teaser" slide that
highlights some of those layers in the [AJAX Abstraction](/architecture/ajax-abstraction/) video starting
at around the 1 minute mark.


### More Information
If you'd like to know more about the blueprints Lore uses to build the convention-supplied actions, see the
[docs on actions](/architecture/actions/). If you'd like to know more about how the AJAX abstraction tier Lore
uses is built (what the blueprints are built on) see the [docs on AJAX Abstraction](/architecture/ajax-abstraction/).

If none of those docs are sufficient to answer your question, please [file an issue](https://github.com/lore/lore/issues)
and we'll answer your question and use it to better expand the documentation for others.
