# Routing
This section documents the parts of Lore that are directly relevant to React-Router. For now that means how to
specify your routes and change the default config settings for React-Router.

The video below is an excerpt from the full [Introduction to Lore](/audience/introduction-to-lore/)
video and provides a summary of how Lore helps with routing.

## Relevant Files
The files below are worth calling out as especially relevant to React-Router in terms of where the routes are
specified and how to change the router's default configuration settings.

### routes.js
This file is where you specify your route hierarchy. `Master` should always be the root component unless
you really know what you're doing. `Layout` is a recommended pattern, but can be renamed or deleted
without affecting the application (it's not special).

```js
import React from 'react';
import { Route, IndexRoute, Redirect } from 'react-router';

var Master = require('./src/components/Master');
var Layout = require('./src/components/Layout');

module.exports = (
  <Route component={Master}>
    <Route path="/" component={Layout} />
  </Route>
);
```

### config/router.js
This file is where you define overrides for the default routing behavior. Currently the only option here is how you
want your routing displayed; using hash history or push state. You can find more information about these options
on the [GitHub page for the `history` library](https://github.com/ReactJSTraining/history).

> This config file will change as soon as Lore updates to using the v2 version of React-Router.

```js
var createBrowserHistory = require('history/lib/createBrowserHistory');

module.exports = {

  /****************************************************************************
