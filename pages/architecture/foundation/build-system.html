# Build System
This section documents the parts of Lore that are directly relevant to Webpack. For now that means the development
server and the Webpack configuration.

The video below is an excerpt from the full [Introduction to Lore](/audience/introduction-to-lore/)
video and provides a summary of how Lore helps with Webpack.

## Relevant Files
The files below are worth calling out as especially relevant to Webpack in terms of the development server and
modifying the Webpack configuration.

### server.js

This is the development webpack server.  It is required if you want to support the awesomeness
[that is hot reloading](https://vimeo.com/100010922). This is the file that gets executed when you run
`npm start`. By default it will make your project available on port 3000. In production, this file is never
executed. Instead, the `index.html` file is served up, and the browser looks for `/dist/bundle.js` (which webpack
will have built when the project when the project was deployed).

### webpack/config.js

This is the common webpack config, which can be overridden on a per-environment basis by adding settings to one of the
config files in `webpack/env/`.

> In the future this section will also include a breakdown of what all the Webpack config settings means and what
> defaults Lore comes with.

### webpack/env/

This directory is where you can place custom webpack configs that should be used when building for a specific
environment such as development, production or staging. Feel free to delete these files or add more. The name of
the file used matches whatever your current `NODE_ENV`is set to

So if your current node environment is `NODE_ENV=production` the final Webpack config will be
`webpack/config.js` overidden by any settings in `webpack/env/production.js`.
