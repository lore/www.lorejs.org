# Custom Hook Tutorial: Overview

Creating your own hooks for Lore is a great way to expand or modify the functionality provided by the framework, and
this tutorial will teach you how to do that.

To illustrate the process we're going to be using the application below, which displays a list of tweets. In this
tutorial, we're going to implement a custom hook that provide basic polling behavior (repeatedly making an API call
on a given interval) so that we can keep the data in sync across multiple browser tabs as we create and edit tweets.
