# Step 1: Clone Starter Project

In this step we'll clone and run repository we'll be adding a custom hook to.

### Clone the Repo
First clone the repo containing the starter code for this tutorial.

{% tabs tab1={"name": "SSH", "id": 101} | tab2={"name": "HTTPS", "id": 102} %}
{% tab id=101, is_active=true %}
```sh
$ git clone git@github.com:lore/lore-hook-tutorial.git
```
{% endtab %}
{% tab id=102 %}
```jsx
$ git clone https://github.com/lore/lore-hook-tutorial.git
```
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

> NOTE: The written code in this tutorial will be displayed in both ES5 and ES6 syntax, but the code in the repository
> was written in ES6. If that causes any trouble or confusion for you, please [file an issue on GitHub](https://github.com/lore/lore/issues).

### Switch Branch to Step-1
The code for the beginning of the tutorial is in the `step-1` branch, so check out that branch to follow along with
the tutorial.

```sh
$ git checkout step-1
```

### Install the Dependencies
Next install the dependencies:

```sh
npm install
```

### Start the API Server
Just like the Quickstart, this project uses `json-server` to provide us with a real API interface. Run this to command
to start the server:

```sh
npm run server
```

Once the server is running, you should be able to navigate to `http://localhost:1337` and see a list of API endpoints.

### Build the Project
Finally, run this command to build the project and start the development server:

```sh
npm start
```

Once the project is built, open a web browser and visit `http://localhost:3000`.


### Visual Check-in

If everything went well, you should see this in your browser.
