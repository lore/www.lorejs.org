# Routing
Lore uses [React-Router](https://github.com/reactjs/react-router) for the routing tier. There isn't
much the framework can do to make it easier to use (it's pretty straight forward) but this page will be filled
with common examples overtime.

### Modifying your Routes
All routes for Lore should be placed in the `routes.js` file at the root of your project.

```js
import React from 'react';
import { Route, IndexRoute, Redirect } from 'react-router';

var Master = require('./src/components/Master');
var Home = require('./src/components/Home');

module.exports = (
  <Route>
    <Redirect from="/" to="/todos" query={% raw %}{{filter: 'all'}}{% endraw %} />
    <Route path="/" component={Master}>
      <Route path="todos" component={Home} />
    </Route>
  </Route>
);
```

### Using Routing
Will fill this out with examples overtime, but for now please see the
[section discussing react-router](/architecture/libraries/react-router/) for links to learning resources.
