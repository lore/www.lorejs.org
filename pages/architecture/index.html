# Purpose

There are a lot of demands on front-end applications as they continuously evolve to support the growing needs of
the user base. Lore's goal is to build support for as many of those common needs into the architecture as possible.

This section will describe what Lore does to improve the experience related to:
* the foundational libraries that make up the framework
* the UI features the framework supports
* and discussion about the architecture and extensibility of the framework itself

### Foundation
The video below provides an overview of how Lore simplifies React development, as well as how it integrates
support for Webpack, Redux, React-Router and Publishing,

### Architecture
This section discusses principles or aspects of Lore that apply to multiple features, or make up the foundation
of the architecture. This section will be expanded in the future to demonstrate how to extend Lore with your
own plugins and behavior.
