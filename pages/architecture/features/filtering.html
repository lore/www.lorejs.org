# Filtering: Architecture
Challenge when implementing filtering and architectural approach Lore uses to address it.

### Challenge
The challenge when incorporating filtering in your applications architecture is preventing action/reducer explosion.
While sending a query to the server is fairly straight forward, the challenge is whether you can implement the
functionality in a way where you don't need to add additional actions/reducers for every different type of question
you need to ask.

### Implementation
This video describes how Lore implements filtering.
