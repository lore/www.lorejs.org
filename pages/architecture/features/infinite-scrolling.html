# Infinite Scrolling: Architecture
Challenge when implementing infinite scrolling and architectural approach Lore uses to address it.

### Challenge
The core challenge here is recognizing that Infinite Scrolling is primarily a view concern, in that it's exactly the
same as traditional pagination except for how the data is displayed to the user.

### Implementation
Since Infinite Scrolling shares the same infrastructure as traditional pagination, please see
[Pagination](/features/challenges/pagination/) for a description of how to implement support for it.
