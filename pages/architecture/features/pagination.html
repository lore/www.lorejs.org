# Pagination: Architecture
Challenge when implementing pagination and architectural approach Lore uses to address it.

### Challenge
The core challenge here, similar to filtering, is preventing action/reducer explosion, but also being able to work
_along side_ filtering. Both of these involve slicing data up into pieces and you need both of them to work
together and side-by-side.

### Implementation
This video describes how Lore implements pagination.

> NOTE: Seeing as pagination is no longer a proposal (and is now part of the framework) this video is currently
> outdated. The approach it illustrates however does closely describe how Lore implements pagination.
>
> In the future this video will be updated to fully reflect the final implementation.
