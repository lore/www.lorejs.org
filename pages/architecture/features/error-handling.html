# Error Handling: Architecture
Challenge when implementing Error Handling and architectural approach Lore uses to address it.

### Challenge
The challenge when incorporating error handling into your applications architecture is making sure server errors
are communicated back to components, so we can can inform the user when something bad happened and at least give
them a chance to copy out their data or fix and retry the request.

### Implementation
This video describes how Lore provides support for error handling.
