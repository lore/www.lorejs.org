# Optimistic Updates: Architecture
Challenge when implementing Optimistic Updates and architectural approach Lore uses to address it.

### Challenge
The challenge with incorporating support for optimistic updates is making sure we can merge the optimistic data
that we _assume_ will be created successfully with the real data once it comes back from the server, and all
while preventing duplicate data from appearing in the reducers.

### Implementation
This video describes how Lore provides support for optimistic updates.
