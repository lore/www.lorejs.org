# Reducers
Reducers are responsible for storing and updating application state. They receive actions dispatched from the action
creators, and based on the ActionType, update the piece of Store state they're responsible for.

You can learn more about reducers [in the official Redux documentation](http://redux.js.org/docs/basics/Reducers.html).

When you create a model in Lore, the framework automatically creates a set of reducers for storing resources
individually (the `byId` and `byCid` reducers) as well as the `find` reducer which caches server responses based
on query and pagination information.

The blueprints have an implicit file structure that looks like this:

```
|-src
  |-models
    |-post.js
  |-reducers
    |-post
      |-byCid.js
      |-byId.js
      |-find.js
```

All blueprints reducers can be overridden by creating a file that matches the location of the blueprint. For
example, if you wanted to override the `find` blueprint for a `post` model, you would create your own reducer
at `reducers/post/find.js`.

```
|-src
  |-models
    |-post.js
  |-reducers
    |-post
      |-find.js
```


### Extracting the Existing Reducers
If you're ever curious what the blueprints for Lore look like, or need a quick way to modify a specific reducer's
behavior, Lore provides a CLI command that will provide a model-specific copy of the blueprints for you to
debug and/or modify.

To extract the reducers for the `post` model in our example above, run this command:

```
lore extract reducer post
```

You can learn more about the `extract` command in the [CLI documentation](http://localhost:4000/cli/).
