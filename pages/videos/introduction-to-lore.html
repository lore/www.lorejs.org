# Introduction to Lore
Lore's goal is to simplify the "getting started" journey with React, and to create an experience where you can
start building serious applications without knowing anything more than React itself.

To do that, the framework bundles a set of popular libraries (Webpack, Redux, React-Router) and configures them
with sensible defaults. It also significantly simplifies what is one of the most time consuming parts of React
development; writing code to communicate with API servers.

To understand _how_ Lore makes it easier to get started with React, the project structure, and the design
philosophy behind the framework, check out the video below.
