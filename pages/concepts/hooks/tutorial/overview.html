# Custom Hooks: Overview

This tutorial will walk you through the process of creating a custom hook for Lore and integrating it into your
application.

The application we'll be working with piggy-backs of the Quickstart and looks like this:

In this tutorial we'll be creating a hook that will invoke any action we want on a timed interval. We'll be using this
functionality to repeatedly fetch the tweets from the server, which will allow us to have multiple browser tabs open
that will all stay in sync as we create, edit and delete tweets.
