# Step 7: Publishing the Hook

If you plan on [publishing your hook to npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/publishing-npm-packages), and your
hook was generated inside an ES6 or ESNext project, you'll need to make a small change to the `package.json` before
doing so.

> You can view the finished code for this step by checking out the `step-7` branch.

> NOTE: This step does NOT apply to hooks built using ES5.


### Build the Hook
If you're using ES6 or ESNext, the hook will include a `.babelrc` file at the root to transpile the code into ES5.
Before you publish, you should run `npm install` inside the hook to make sure it builds properly. The transpiled code
will be placed in a `lib/` directory, and the final project structure will look like this:

```sh
polling-hook
|-- lib
|   |--index.js
|-- src
|   |--index.js
|-- test
|   |-- test.spec.js
|-- .babelrc
|-- package.json
|-- README.md
```

### Modify the `package.json` to use `lib/index.js`
Because it can be convenient to first develop hooks inside a project, the `main` attribute of the `package.json` file
points to `src/index.js` as the file that should be loaded when consuming the hook. When the hook exists inside your
project, this isn't a problem, as the babel loader used by your project will transpile it as part of the build.

But if you plan on [publishing your hook to npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/publishing-npm-packages), this
may cause problems with projects that consume the code if those projects aren't configured with the same babel presets
and plugins as your project. In order to make sure your hook works well with any project, it's recommended that you
modify the `main` property of your `package.json` to point to `lib/index.js` before publishing, so that projects will
load the transpiled version of your hook.

```json
{
  ...
  "main": "lib/index.js",
  ...
}
```

### Remove `.default` from `require` statement in `/index.js`
Now that we're using the transpiled code in `lib/index.js` in our project, we no longer need the `.default` extension
to load the hook in file `index.js` file at the root of the project.

Update your `index.js` file to remove the `.default` extension from the `require('./polling-hook').default` line:

```jsx
...
lore.summon({
  hooks: {
    ...
    models: require('lore-hook-models'),
    polling: require('./polling-hook'),
    reducers: require('lore-hook-reducers'),
    ...
  }
});
```
