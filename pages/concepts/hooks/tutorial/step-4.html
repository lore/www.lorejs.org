# Step 4: Make Configurable

In this step we're going to make our hook configurable so it can be overriden on an app-level or on a per-model basis.

> You can view the finished code for this step by checking out the `step-4` branch.

### Hook Configuration
It's good practice to expose configuration values that will allow the user to tailor the behavior of your hook,
provided there are configuration values that make sense to expose.

Lore exposes many configuration values, and it's these values that allow the framework to adapt to different needs
such as varying API conventions, hash-based or push-state routes, and adding headers to AJAX requests.

In addition to exposing config values, Lore also encourages a pattern cascading overrides, which looks like this:

1. Hooks decide what values to make configurable, and expose those values to the framework (they also provide a default
value)
2. Config files in the `config/` directory (such as `config/models.js`) allow the user to override those defaults and
change the behavior of that hook across the whole application.
3. Config files in the `src/models` and `src/collections` directories allow the user to override the application
level configuration and change the behavior a per-model (or per-endpoint) basis.

This approach is designed to require the least amount of configuration by the user, while also providing a high level
of adaptability, and we'll be configuring our custom hook to use this approach.


### Add Default Values
First, we need to think about what config values to expose. In this case, our hook is going to invoke an action on
some interval (every X seconds), so let's make that interval configurable.

Open up `polling-hook/src/index.js` and modify the `defaults` object to look like this:

```js
...
  defaults: {
    polling: {
      interval: 3000
    }
  },
...
```

The default config for Lore is composed by combining all the of the `defaults` from every hook that gets loaded. To
prove that, open the console in the browser's developer tools and type this command:

```
lore.config.polling.interval
```

You should see `3000` printed out as the value. At this point we have successfully exposed the polling `interval` to
the user and set it's default value to 3 seconds.

> The reason you have to specify `polling` inside the `defaults` object is because hooks have the potential to define
> or override config values outside their own hook.


### Add Application-Level Config
Now that we've added a default config to our hook, let's give the user the ability to change the default interval. To
do that, create a config file called `polling`, located at `config/polling.js`. Paste this code into that file:

{% tabs tab1={"name": "ES5", "id": 101} | tab2={"name": "ES6", "id": 102} | tab3={"name": "ESNext", "id": 103} %}
{% tab id=101, is_active=true %}
```jsx
module.exports = {

   /**
    * The frequency at which the action should be invoked (in milliseconds)
    */

  interval: 5000

};
```
{% endtab %}
{% tab id=102 %}
```jsx
export default {

   /**
    * The frequency at which the action should be invoked (in milliseconds)
    */

  interval: 5000

}
```
{% endtab %}
{% tab id=103 %}
```jsx
export default {

   /**
    * The frequency at which the action should be invoked (in milliseconds)
    */

  interval: 5000

}
```
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

With that file in place, the user can now change the `interval` value and it will override the default provided by
the hook. In this case, we're changing the default interval of 3000 milliseconds to 5000 milliseconds.


### Add Model-Level Config
While it's great that the user can now override the default at an app level (through `config/polling.js`) they might
need to change that behavior on a per-model basis. For example, maybe some models change more quickly than others,
and the user may need to adjust the polling frequency accordingly.

Luckily accommodating that is pretty easy to. Open up `models/tweet.js` and add a section for a polling config:

{% tabs tab1={"name": "ES5", "id": 104} | tab2={"name": "ES6", "id": 105} | tab3={"name": "ESNext", "id": 106} %}
{% tab id=104, is_active=true %}
```js
module.exports = {
  attributes: {
    // ...
  },

  polling: {
    interval: 2000
  },

  properties: {
    // ...
  }
};
```
{% endtab %}
{% tab id=105 %}
```js
export default {
  attributes: {
    // ...
  },

  polling: {
    interval: 2000
  },

  properties: {
    // ...
  }
}
```
{% endtab %}
{% tab id=106 %}
```js
export default {
  attributes: {
    // ...
  },

  polling: {
    interval: 2000
  },

  properties: {
    // ...
  }
}
```
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

Which this change, we've now declared that we want to change the application interval of 5000 milliseconds to be
2000 milliseconds, but _only_ when polling for tweets.

### Update Hook to Read Config Values
At this point we've set up our application to declare cascading overrides, but we still need to implement that
behavior in our hook. Let's work on that now.

Open up `polling-hook/src/index.js` and update the `load` method to look like this:

{% tabs tab1={"name": "ES5", "id": 107} | tab2={"name": "ES6", "id": 108} | tab3={"name": "ESNext", "id": 109} %}
{% tab id=107, is_active=true %}
```jsx
...
  load: function(lore) {
    // 1. Get the actions so we can make them pollable
    var actions = lore.actions;

    // 2. Get the application level config (defaults + config/polling.js)
    var appConfig = lore.config.polling;

    // 3. Get the model specific configs
    var modelConfigs = lore.loader.loadModels();

    // TODO: create a pollable version of each action
  }
...
```
{% endtab %}
{% tab id=108 %}
```jsx
...
  load: (lore) => {
    // 1. Get the actions so we can make them pollable
    const actions = lore.actions;

    // 2. Get the application level config (defaults + config/polling.js)
    const appConfig = lore.config.polling;

    // 3. Get the model specific configs
    const modelConfigs = lore.loader.loadModels();

    // TODO: create a pollable version of each action
  }
...
```
{% endtab %}
{% tab id=109 %}
```jsx
...
  load: (lore) => {
    // 1. Get the actions so we can make them pollable
    const actions = lore.actions;

    // 2. Get the application level config (defaults + config/polling.js)
    const appConfig = lore.config.polling;

    // 3. Get the model specific configs
    const modelConfigs = lore.loader.loadModels();

    // TODO: create a pollable version of each action
  }
...
```
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

There's a few things happening here, so let's break down each line to discuss what this code means.

#### 1. Actions
Because we declared a dependency on `bindActions`, we know that `lore.actions` is going to exist, and that it will
be populated with all of the actions in the application, a structure that looks like this:

```jsx
lore.actions = {
  ...
  tweet: {
    create: function() {...},
    destroy: function() {...},
    find: function() {...},
    get: function() {...},
    update: function() {...}
  },
  ...
}
```

#### 2. App Config
The application configuration is composed before any actions load, and is composed of the hook defaults overridden
with any values specified in files in the `config/` directory. Here we're accessing the config object, and extracting
the portion of the configuration specific to `polling` behavior.

#### 3. Model Configs
To get the model-specific configuration files, we're invoking `lore.loader.loadModels()`.

The framework includes a series of loaders that convert project directories into objects. In this case, we want all
the files in `src/models/`, since those are the config files we need to examine for `polling` overrides. To get them
we can use the `models` loader invoked by calling `lore.loader.loadModels()`. This method will return an object that
looks like this:

```jsx
{
  currentUser: {/* files contents */},
  tweet: {/* files contents */},
  user: {/* files contents */}
}
```

> In this case, we don't want `lore.models` because that contains the actual Model classes the framework uses to make
> AJAX calls.
>
> The `models` hook uses this same loader to get the config files, and then converts those files into instances of
> Model stored under `lore.models`.

## Next Steps
Next we're going to [implement the functionality of our hook](../step-5/).
