# Step 2: Generate the Hook

In this step we're going to generate the custom hook.

### Run the Generator
The Lore CLI includes a number of commands that can generate files. Among them is a command that will generate starter
code for a custom hook. Run this command to create a hook called `polling-hook`:

```sh
lore generate hook polling-hook
```

This command will create a folder called `polling-hook` at the root of your project, and place the starter code for a
hook inside that folder. The structure should look like this:

```sh
polling-hook
|-- src
|   |--index.js
|-- test
|   |-- test.spec.js
|-- package.json
|-- README.md
```

### Add the Hook
Now that we've generated the hook, let's add it to the project so it gets loaded when the application boots up.

Open up `index.js` file at the root of your project and insert the `polling-hook` into the list of hooks. Note that
we're using a relative path, since the hook is located within our project and _not_ installed as an npm module.

```jsx
...
lore.summon({
  hooks: {
    ...
    models: require('lore-hook-models'),
    polling: require('./lore-hook-polling'),
    reducers: require('lore-hook-reducers'),
    ...
  }
});
```

With this change in place, the hook will now be loaded as the application boots up. To prove that, open up the file
`polling-hook/src/index.js`. It currently it looks like this:

```jsx
module.exports = {

  dependencies: [],

  defaults: {},

  load: function(lore) {
    // do something
  }

};
```

Modify the `load` function to look like this:

```js
...
  load: function(lore) {
    console.log('polling-hook loading!');
  }
...
```

Now open the developer tools in the browser and refresh the page. If you examine the console, you should see the phrase
`polling-hook loading!` printed out.


## Next Steps
Next we're going to [specify our hook dependencies](../step-3/).
