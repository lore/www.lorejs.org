# Actions
Actions are responsible for server communicating and emitting the proper events to reducers to enable them to
accurately keep track of the applications state.

When you create a model in Lore, the framework automatically creates a set of actions for finding, creating,
updating, deleting, and getting that resource. The blueprints have an implicit file structure that looks like
this:

```
|-src
  |-actions
    |-post
      |-create.js
      |-destroy.js
      |-find.js
      |-get.js
      |-update.js
  |-models
    |-post.js
```

All blueprints actions can be overridden by creating a file that matches the location of the blueprint. For
example, if you wanted to override the `create` blueprint for a `post` model, you would
create your own action at `actions/post/create.js`.

```
|-src
  |-actions
    |-post
      |-create.js
  |-models
    |-post.js
```


There are two ways to override an action.

### Override Option #1: Template

If your file contains an object, Lore will assume you just want to tailor (or tap into) the existing blueprint
behavior, but you don't want to change the underlying implementation. This is useful if (for some reason) you
wanted to turn off the default optimistic update behavior.

This approach is also useful if you want to listen and log errors, or display them to the user using
<a href="https://www.google.com/design/spec/components/snackbars-toasts.html">a snackbar or toast</a>. This
can be achieved by defining a `beforeDispatch` function, example below.

At the moment, the `beforeDispatch` property only exists on the error path.

```js
module.exports = {

  // comments
  optimistic: {
    actionType: ActionTypes.ADD_POST,
    payloadState: PayloadStates.CREATING
  },

  // comments
  onSuccess: {
    actionType: ActionTypes.UPDATE_POST,
    payloadState: PayloadStates.RESOLVED
  },

  // comments
  onError: {
    actionType: ActionTypes.REMOVE_POST,
    payloadState: PayloadStates.ERROR_CREATING,
    beforeDispatch: function(response, args){
      console.log({
        message: "Post could not be created",
        response: response
      });
    }
  }
};
```

### Override Option #2: Full Replacement

If your file contains a function, Lore will assume you want to replace the blueprint with your own implementation.
While the need to do this should be rare, this would be necessary if (for example) you needed to make multiple
API calls to complete an operation, or if the API was forcing business logic into the client (bad) and if a request
failed you needed to make an API call to rollback changes or something. For well behaved/designed and
convention-abiding APIs, the need to overwrite the default blueprint actions completely should be fairly uncommon.

```js
module.exports = function create( params ) {
  return function( dispatch ) {
    var post = new Post(params);

    post.save().then(function() {
      dispatch({
        type: ActionTypes.UPDATE_POST,
        payload: payload(model, PayloadStates.RESOLVED)
      });
    }).catch(function( response ) {
      var error = response.responseJSON;
      dispatch({
        type: ActionTypes.UPDATE_POST,
        payload: payload(model, PayloadStates.ERROR_CREATING, error)
      });
    });

    return dispatch({
      type: ActionTypes.ADD_POST,
      payload: payload(model, PayloadStates.CREATING)
    });
  };
};
```

### Override Option #3: Redefine the Blueprints

While not an option at the moment, Lore will be providing the ability to define your own blueprints, in case you
want (or need) to overwrite the default behavior across all models.
