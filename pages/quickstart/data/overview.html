# Data Structure: Overview

In this section we'll learn about the data structure Lore uses and then create our Tweet component using mock data. At
the end of this section your application will look like this:

### Lore's Data Structure
Lore has a particular structure it uses to represent data in your application. To illustrate, take a look at this
example `Tweet` component. It expects to receive a prop called `tweet` and then renders the `tweet` data:

{% tabs tab1={"name": "ES5", "id": 101} | tab2={"name": "ES6", "id": 102} | tab3={"name": "ESNext", "id": 103} %}
{% tab id=101, is_active=true %}
```jsx
var React = require('react');

module.exports = React.createClass({
  displayName: 'Tweet',

  propTypes: {
    tweet: React.PropTypes.object.isRequired
  },

  render: function() {
    var tweet = this.props.tweet;

    return (
      {/* render tweet */}
    );
  }
});
```
{% endtab %}
{% tab id=102 %}
```jsx
import React, { Component, PropTypes } from 'react';

export default class Tweet extends Component {
  render() {
    const tweet = this.props.tweet;

    return (
      {/* render tweet */}
    );
  }
}

Tweet.propTypes = {
  tweet: PropTypes.object.isRequired
};

export default Tweet;
```
{% endtab %}
{% tab id=103 %}
```jsx
import React, { Component, PropTypes } from 'react';

export default class Tweet extends Component {

  static propTypes = {
    tweet: PropTypes.object.isRequired
  }

  render() {
    const tweet = this.props.tweet;

    return (
      {/* render tweet */}
    );
  }
}
```
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

But before we can render the tweet, we first need to know what the data structure looks like. In Lore, all resources
have a data structure that looks like this:

```jsx
{
  id: 1,
  cid: 'c1',
  state: 'RESOLVED',
  data: {
    id: 1,
    user: 4,
    text: "Where have they been keeping her!?",
    createdAt: "2016-10-17T23:13:07.249Z",
    updatedAt: "2016-10-23T23:13:07.281Z"
  },
  error: {}
}
```

When Lore retrieves data from an API endpoint (such as `/tweets/1`), it embeds the resource attributes from the
response in the `data` property and then wraps those attributes in a structure that provides some metadata about the
resource.

This might seem a tad verbose at first glance, but each property solves a specific problem, which you can
[read more about about in the docs](/features/foundation/data-structure/) if you'd like. But what
you need to know for the quickstart is that the data structure is designed to solve application concerns related to
optimistic updates, visual communication, server errors, and detecting when resources have been created - all
important elements of a good user experience.

For endpoints that return a list of resources, such as `/tweets`, Lore use's a similar data structure:

```jsx
{
  state: 'RESOLVED',
  data: [
    {...data in structure displayed above...}
  ],
  query: {},
  meta: {},
  error: {},
}
```

Here `data` is an array that contains the individual resources in the server response (each wrapped in the structure
above) and then provides metadata about the list such as what query was made to the API and what the state of that
query is (typically whether the data is still being fetched or the query has been resolved).


## Next Steps

In the next step, we'll use this structure to add some mock data as we [build the Tweet component](../step-1/).
