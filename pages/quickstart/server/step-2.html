# Step 2: Parse Server Response

In this step weâ€™ll restore functionality to our application.


### Why is the application broken?
Our application is broken because the API response from the mock API is different than the response of the real API.
The mock API server had a response for `/tweets` that looked like this:

```js
[
  {...tweet...},
  {...tweet...}
]
```

But now the API response looks like this:

```js
{
  data: [
    {...tweet...},
    {...tweet...}
  ],
  meta: {
    paginate: {
      currentPage: 1,
      nextPage: 2,
      prevPage: null,
      totalPages: 11,
      totalCount: 51,
      perPage: 5
    }
  }
}
```

The reason for the change is a positive one, as we now have clear metadata we can use for pagination. And Lore
is also designed to easily adapt to these kinds of breaking API changes.

### Parse the Collection Response
API responses vary drastically across the web, and Lore is designed to adapt to different interfaces. It just needs
a little help from you to understand how.

To fix our app, open up `config/connections.js`. At the bottom of the file, below the `apiRoot` you set earlier, you
will see a section labled `collections`. Collections in Lore are the abstraction tier responsible for communicating
with API endpoints that return an array of resources, such as our `/tweets` endpoint.

Inside this section you'll see a commented out function called parse that looks like this:

```js
{
  apiRoot: 'http://localhost:1337',

  ...

  collections: {

      properties: {

        // parse(attributes) {
        //   return attributes;
        // }

      }

    }
}
```

It's commented out because it reflects the default behavior of the framework. When the `/tweets` endpoint returns data,
that data is passed to the parse function. This function then has an opportunity to modify the data (referred to as
`attributes`) and is expected to return an array of that resource.

The default behavior is to return whatever the function was provided. And this worked just fine for our mock API,
because the original API response _was_ an array of tweets. But now the array we want is embedded inside the `data`
attribute, so we need to override this function to have it return the array of tweets.

Modify the `parse` function to look like this:

```js
...
  collections: {
    properties: {
      parse(attributes) {
        return attributes.data;
      }
    }
  }
...
```

If you refresh the browser, you'll see the application is still broken, but now we have a different error in the
console:

```sh
Invalid call to `getState('user.byId')`. Missing required attribute `id`.
```

### Parse the Model Response
This error stems from another parsing problem. In our original mock API, the response for a single tweet looked like this:

```js
{
  id: 1,
  userId: 1,
  text: "Ayla fight while alive! Win and live. Lose and die.",
  createdAt: "2016-11-26T04:03:25.546Z"
}
```

But in our current API, the response looks like this:

```js
{
  id: 1,
  user: 1,
  text: "Ayla fight while alive! Win and live. Lose and die.",
  createdAt: "2016-11-26T04:03:25.546Z"
}
```

The difference is that our `userId` property has been renamed to `user`. To solve this problem we _could_ rename every
reference of `userId` in our application to `user`, but Lore provides an alternative way to quickly resolve breaking
API changes like this. Instead of modifying our components, we're simply going to add the missing `user` field to
all tweets.

Models and Collections in Lore both have a `parse` method. The `parse` method on Models is responsible for parsing a
single resource and producing the final set of attributes that will be used by the components in your application.

While `config/collections.js` _does_ contain a parse method for `models`, that method will affect _all_ models in the
application, which isn't what we want as this issue only affects the `tweet` models.

To do this open up `src/models/tweet.js`. Look for the commented out `parse` method which will look like this:

```js
{
  ...
  properties: {

    // parse: function(resp, options) {
    //  return resp;
    // }

  }

}
```

Modify the file to look like this:

{% tabs tab1={"name": "ES5", "id": 101} | tab2={"name": "ES6", "id": 102} | tab3={"name": "ESNext", "id": 103} %}
{% tab id=101, is_active=true %}
```jsx
module.exports = {

  ...

  properties: {

    parse: function(resp, options) {
      resp.userId = resp.user;
      return resp;
    }

  }

}
```
{% endtab %}
{% tab id=102 %}
```jsx
export default {

  ...

  properties: {

    parse: function(resp, options) {
      resp.userId = resp.user;
      return resp;
    }

  }

}
```
{% endtab %}
{% tab id=103 %}
```jsx
export default {

  ...

  properties: {

    parse: function(resp, options) {
      resp.userId = resp.user;
      return resp;
    }

  }

}
```
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

Instead of modifying all the components, we're simply going to create the missing `userId` property and copy over the
value from the `user` property.

> While outside the scope of this quickstart, the approach of overriding parse to resolve breaking API changes only
> works for read-only situations, i.e. when the applications needs to read the property but never modifies it and
> sends it back to the server. If you need to modify a response data sending it to the server you can use the `sync`
> method.

If you refresh the browser, you'll notice the Feed displays correctly again, but our profile picture isn't being
displayed. This is because the application doesn't actually know who the user is. If you open the network tab
you'll see the call to `/user` returns a `401 Unauthorized`. We'll fix that error in the next step.


### Visual Check-in

If everything went well, your application should look like this.
