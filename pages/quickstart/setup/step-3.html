# Step 3: Run the Application
With the dependencies installed, run the application by typing `npm start`.

```sh
$ npm start
```

A successful execution will produce output similar to this:

```sh
  [431] ./~/lore-hook-reducers/lib/blueprints/byId.js 1.33 kB {0} [built]
  [432] ./~/lore-hook-reducers/lib/blueprints/byCid.js 2.48 kB {0} [built]
  [433] ./~/lore-hook-redux/lib/index.js 676 bytes {0} [built]
  [434] ./~/redux-thunk/lib/index.js 529 bytes {0} [built]
  [435] ./~/lore-hook-redux/lib/generateStore.js 497 bytes {0} [built]

webpack: bundle is now VALID.
```

This step invokes [Webpack](https://webpack.github.io/) to build the application and starts a development server so
you can view it in the browser.

### View the Application

Once the application is built, you can view it by navigating to `http://localhost:3000`. Once you do, you
should see this:

### Changing the Port (optional)

If you want to change the port the server runs on, you can do that by using an alternate syntax to start the server.
If you examine the `package.json` file you'll see that `npm start` is just an alias for `node server`, and you can
pass a `port` argument to `node server` like this:

{% tabs tab1={"name": "ES5", "id": 101} | tab2={"name": "ES6", "id": 102} | tab3={"name": "ESNext", "id": 103} %}
{% tab id=101, is_active=true %}
```sh
$ node server --port=3001
```
{% endtab %}
{% tab id=102 %}
```sh
$ ./node_modules/.bin/babel-node server --port=3001
```
{% endtab %}
{% tab id=103 %}
```sh
$ ./node_modules/.bin/babel-node server --port=3001
```
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}


## Next Steps

Next we're going to [setup the mock API server](../step-4/) we'll be using for this quickstart.
