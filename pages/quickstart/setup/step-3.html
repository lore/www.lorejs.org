# Step 3: Run the Application
With the dependencies installed, run the application by typing `npm start`.

```sh
$ npm start
```

A successful execution will produce output similar to this:

```sh
webpack-dev-server --history-api-fallback --hot --env=development --port=3000

build [==                  ] 10%
Project is running at http://localhost:3000/

webpack output is served from /
404s will fallback to /index.html

Build completed in 11.5s

...

webpack: Compiled successfully.
```

This step invokes [Webpack](https://webpack.github.io/) to build the application and starts a development server so
you can view it in the browser.

### View the Application

Once the application is built, you can view it by navigating to `http://localhost:3000`. Once you do, you
should see this:

<img class="drop-shadow" src="/assets/images/quickstart/setup/step-3.png">

### Changing the Port (optional)

If you want to change the port the server runs on, you can do that by modifying the `start` script in the
`package.json` file. Just update the `--port=3000` argument to something like `--port=3001`.

```json
"scripts": {
  ...
  "start": "webpack-dev-server --history-api-fallback --hot --env=development --port=3000",
  ...
},
```


## Next Steps

Next we're going to [setup the mock API server](../step-4/) we'll be using for this quickstart.
