# Step 1: Install the CLI

Before you can use Lore you will first need to install Node.  If you don't already have it installed, please refer to
[these instructions](../../misc/installing-node/).

### Install Lore

To get started with Lore you first need to install the CLI (Command Line Interface). With Node installed, run this
command from the command line:

```sh
$ npm install -g lore-cli
```

Once the CLI is installed you will have access to `lore` from the command line. Run `lore` to see a list of available
commands:

```sh
$ lore

Usage: $ <command>

  Commands:
    new       Create a new application
    extract   Create files that mirror the blueprint behavior
    generate  Generate common project files


  Options:
    --version  Show version number                                       [boolean]
    --help     Show help                                                 [boolean]

  Please enter a valid command.
```

## Next Steps

Now that the `lore-cli` is installed, let's [create a new application](../step-2/).
