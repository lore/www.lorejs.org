# Step 2: Create the Application

To create a new application, type `lore new` into the command line followed the by name of your application. For this
example we are going to call our application `lore-quickstart`.

{% tabs tab1={"name": "ES5", "id": 101} | tab2={"name": "ES6", "id": 102} | tab3={"name": "ESNext", "id": 103} %}
{% tab id=101, is_active=true %}
```sh
$ lore new lore-quickstart
```
{% endtab %}
{% tab id=102 %}
```sh
$ lore new lore-quickstart --es6
```
{% endtab %}
{% tab id=103 %}
```sh
$ lore new lore-quickstart --esnext
```
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

This will create a new directory called `lore-quickstart`, and place all the application files inside. You should see
this message when the task completes.

```sh
  info:  Created a new Lore application `lore-quickstart`
```

> When you create an application using the --es6 or --exnext flags, your language preference is recorded to the
> `language` property in the `.lorerc` file at the root of the project. The CLI examines this property before
> executing commands, which means this is the only time you'll need to declare the JavaScript version. Any files you
> generate from this point forward will be created using your preference automatically.

### Install Dependencies

Once the project is created, navigate into the project directory and install the dependencies.

```sh
$ cd lore-quickstart
$ npm install
```

Depending on your network connection, it may take 2-4 minutes for this step to complete.

## Next Steps

Now that we've created our project and installed the dependencies, let's [build the application](../step-3/).
