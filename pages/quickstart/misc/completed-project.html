# Completed Project

<div class="alert alert-danger" role="alert">
<div>
  <strong>IMPORTANT!!</strong>
</div>
<br/>
<div>
  The quickstart repository <strong>DOES NOT</strong> reflect changes introduced in <strong>v0.12</strong> yet.
  The code still reflects <strong>v0.11</strong>, which has a different webpack configuration and has no support
  for normalization.
</div>
<br/>
<div>
  This message will be removed as soon as soon as the code is updated. In the meantime, cloning the example repo
  is <strong>NOT RECOMMENDED</strong>.
</div>
</div>

The final code for the Quickstart can be checked out from GitHub using the link below:

{% tabs tab1={"name": "ES5", "id": 101} | tab2={"name": "ES6", "id": 102} | tab3={"name": "ESNext", "id": 103} %}
{% tab id=101, is_active=true %}
```sh
git clone git@github.com:lore/lore-quickstart-es5.git
```
{% endtab %}
{% tab id=102 %}
```sh
git clone git@github.com:lore/lore-quickstart-es6.git
```
{% endtab %}
{% tab id=103 %}
```sh
git clone git@github.com:lore/lore-quickstart-esnext.git
```
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

Each step in the quickstart contains the name of the branch with the completed code for that step. For example, to
check out the code for Step 1 of the Authorization section, which has the branch name `authorization.1`, you would
run this command:

```sh
git checkout authorization.1
```
