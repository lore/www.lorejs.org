# Next Steps

Congratulations! You've reached the end of the Quickstart. One of the challenges with using a somewhat realistic
application for a walkthrough is that you get some realistic challenges that pop up during the course of building
it. I want to call out some of these challenges now, partly just to recognize they exist, and partly to discuss a
solution (which will be added as another section at a later date).

## Problem: New Tweets do not show up at top of Feed

Ever since we introduced pagination, new tweets stopped showing up in the Feed when you create them. This certainly
doesn't match the expected user experience. The reason for this is that the application doesn't know what to do with
the new tweets you create. What the application is displaying is exactly what you asked for; the first page of tweets.

You'll also notice that if you DO create a tweet, and then you try to load the next page of tweets, the console fills
with this error:

```
Warning: flattenChildren(...): Encountered two children with the same key
```

This error is caused by the fact that some of the tweets on the first page are ALSO on the second page. When you
created a new tweet, it was saved to the server, and this modified which tweets appear on which page. The 5th tweet
on the page you see is actually part of page 2 now. So when you request the second page of tweets, the 5th tweet is
included, and React tries to render it twice, which throws the error above, because two React components have the same
key (the id of the tweet).

There are two challenges to solving this problem.

### Challenge #1: Pagination Timestamp
First, you need freeze the timestamp used for pagination. One way to do this is to get the timestamp of when the
application loads, and then provide is as an argument in the `tweet.find` call of the `Feed` component like this:

```jsx
...
var timestamp = moment().format();

module.exports = lore.connect(function(getState, props) {
  return {
    tweets: getState('tweet.find', {
      where: {
        where: {
          createdAt: {
            '<=': timestamp
          }
        }
      },
      pagination: {
        sort: 'createdAt DESC',
        page: 1
      }
    })
  }
})(
React.createClass({
  displayName: 'Feed',
  ...
})
);
```

In the code above, the timestamp will never change, because it's established when the application loads. This means
that tweets created after the application loads will never be included in the pagination, because it's always requesting
tweets created BEFORE that point in time.

### Challenge #2: Showing New Tweets
The second challenge is displaying new Tweets in the Feed. The timestamp fix above guarantees the application as-is
will never display tweets we create. So to fix this we need to modify the application to detect and display new tweets.

Luckily just because the application isn't _displaying_ new tweets doesn't mean they aren't being stored. Every tweet
in the application is stored by its `id` the `tweet.byId` reducer, which you can see if you open up the browser's
developer console and enter this command:

```js
lore.store.getState().tweet.byId
```

So one way to find all the new tweets would be to iterate through that dictionary every render cycle, and grab any
tweets created after the timestamp used in pagination, like this:

```js
var timestamp = moment().format();
...
var storeState = lore.store.getState();

var newTweets = Object.keys(storeState.tweet.byId).filter(function(id) {
  var tweet = storeState.tweet.byId[id];
  var createdAt = moment(tweet.data.createdAt);
  return createdAt.diff(timestamp) > 0;
}).map(function(id) {
  return storeState.tweet.byId[id];
});
```

That function will return an array of tweets created after the `timestamp`. However, since Tweet's don't receive an
`id` until AFTER they return from the server, that will only give you tweets that ACTUALLY exist. If you want to
display tweets optimistically, before the server confirms their creation, then you'd need to iterate through the
`tweet.byCid` reducer that stores tweets by their client-side id (cid). It's the same code, just a different reducer:

```js
var timestamp = moment().format();
...
var storeState = lore.store.getState();

var newTweets = Object.keys(storeState.tweet.byCid).filter(function(cid) {
  var tweet = storeState.tweet.byCid[cid];
  var createdAt = moment(tweet.data.createdAt);
  return createdAt.diff(timestamp) > 0;
}).map(function(cid) {
  return storeState.tweet.byCid[cid];
});
```

Once you have the list of new tweets, you just need to modify your Feed component to render the list of new tweets
at the top of the page.

## What about real-time, e.g. WebSockets?
WebSockets is absolutely a focus area for Lore, and beta support is already integrated, which you can see in the
[websockets example](https://github.com/lore/lore/tree/master/examples/websockets) if you're curious. In time the
Quickstart be expanded to demonstrate it as well. But for now, it lives "behind the scenes" until some higher priority
features are finished (like automatic normalization of API responses).

## That's all for now
That's all for now. If you have any questions, issues, features requests, ideas to improve the user experience, or
just want additional thoughts about how to solve a front-end challenge with Lore, don't hesitate to
[submit an issue](https://github.com/lore/lore/issues) with your thoughts!
