# Next Steps

Congratulations! You've reached the end of the Quickstart. One of the challenges with using a somewhat realistic
application for a walkthrough is that you get some realistic challenges that pop up during the course of building
it. I want to call out some of these challenges now, which will be added as another section at a later date.

## Problem: Form has no validation

Form submission is an important part of many applications, and the current `lore-hook-dialogs-bootstrap` isn't a
very practical solution. It's useful as an idea, and to highlight what a hook *could* do, but it's practical use
is very limited outside of simply applications.

The next version of Lore, `v0.13`, will focus on providing a real solutions for forms and form validation, and will
try to leverage that to make the dialogs hook for useful and provide build in validation.

## That's all for now
That's all for now. If you have any questions, issues, features requests, ideas to improve the user experience, or
just want additional thoughts about how to solve a front-end challenge with Lore, don't hesitate to
[submit an issue](https://github.com/lore/lore/issues) with your thoughts!
