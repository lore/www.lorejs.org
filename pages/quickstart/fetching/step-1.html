# Step 1: Set the API Location

In this step we're going to set the location of the API server.


### The Config Folder
At the root of your project you should see a folder called `config`. This folder exposes all of the controls you can
use to tailor Lore's behavior to your applications needs.

Navigate into this folder and open a file called `connections.js`.

Toward the top of this file you will see a commented out line that looks like this:

```js
...
  default: {

    // apiRoot: 'https://api.example.com',

    ...
  }
...
```

> Lore is designed to interact with multiple API endpoints. The config settings for each API is called a `connection`.
> New projects begin configured for a single API, and this connection is named `default`.

You'll see commented out sections like this in all of the config files, and they represent the built-in defaults that
Lore uses. In this case, Lore assumes your API is located at `https://api.example.com`, which is obviously not true.

Tell Lore where the API is located by uncommenting that line and change it to the following:

```js
...
  apiRoot: 'http://localhost:1337',
...
```

With this change in place, we're almost ready to fetch data.

> *Environment-specific Configurations*
>
> You may notice a `/env` folder in `/config` that contains files called `development.js` and `production.js`. These
> files allow you to customize the config on a per-environment basis. For example, if your NODE_ENV is set to
> `production`, the final configuration will be all of the files located in `/config`, overriden by any settings
> you've specified in `/config/production.js`.
>
> The`/config/local.js` file ONLY applies to your local environment, and is included in the .gitignore by
> default so that it will never be checked in.

### Visual Check-in

If everything went well, your application should now look like this. Exactly the same before :)

## Code Changes

Below is a list of files modified during this step.

### config/connections.js

{% tabs tab1={"name": "ES5", "id": 1} | tab3={"name": "ES6", "id": 2} | tab4={"name": "ESNext", "id": 3} %}
{% tab id=1, is_active=true %}
```jsx
module.exports = {
  default: {
    apiRoot: 'http://localhost:1337'
  }
};
```
{% endtab %}
{% tab id=2 %}
```jsx
export default {
  default: {
    apiRoot: 'http://localhost:1337'
  }
}
```
{% endtab %}
{% tab id=3 %}
```jsx
export default {
  default: {
    apiRoot: 'http://localhost:1337'
  }
}
```
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}
