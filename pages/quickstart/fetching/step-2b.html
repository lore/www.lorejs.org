# Convention over Configuration

As you'll soon see, we now have all the code required to fetch tweets from the API. Lore accomplishes this using
a philosophy called **convention-over-configuration**. With this approach the framework makes some assumptions about
what you want, and then provides you with the ability to override those assumptions if you need to.

If you'd like to see some of this functionality demonstrated now, and are comfortable using the console provided in
the developer tools for your browser, you may follow along with the steps below. If not, feel free to
[skip this step](../step-3/). It is entirely optional.

### Console Demo: Actions
To illustrate, refresh the browser and open up the developer console. Then enter this command into the console:

```js
lore.actions.tweet.find()
```

When you created the `tweet` model Lore assumed you wanted a set of actions that could find, create, update and
delete tweets. After creating these actions, it attached them to `lore.actions`. The command you just entered invoked
the `find` action to fetch tweets from the API. And if you examine the network tab, you can see that a network request
was indeed sent out to `http://localhost:1337/tweets`.

> The URL was composed from a convention, which defaults to "pluralize the model name and append it to the apiRoot". You
> can change this convention as needed by modifying the `model` settings for pluralization, casing style, or simply
> providing an explicit endpoint.

You can also fetch tweets by a specific user, by providing an object of query parameters to find() like this:

```js
lore.actions.tweet.find({
  userId: 1
})
```

### Console Demo: Reducers & Store State
In addition to create a set of actions, Lore also produces a set of reducers that store the tweets returned by the API.
To see the list of tweets returned for example, enter this command into the developer console:

```js
lore.store.getState().tweet.byId
```

That's pretty impressive, but we're not done yet. In the next section we'll learn how components can declare what data
they need.

## Next Steps

Next we're going to [connect our Feed to real data](../step-3/).
