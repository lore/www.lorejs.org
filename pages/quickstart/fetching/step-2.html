# Step 2: Create a Tweet Model

In this step we're going to create a model for our tweet, and learn about the implicit functionality provided by Lore.


### Create a Tweet Model
Before you can fetch data in Lore, you first need to create a model that represents the resource you want to fetch.
Since we want to fetch tweets, we are going to create a `tweet` model by running this command:

```
lore generate model tweet
```

This will create a `tweet` model and place the file at `src/models/tweet.js`. Open this file and you will see comments
showing you some of the properties you can override along with their default values. But if you ignore all the
comments this file is essentially empty:

```js
module.exports = {

};
```

### Visual Check-in

If everything went well, your application should now look like this. Still the same as before :)

## Code Changes

Below is a list of files modified during this step.

### src/models/tweet.js

{% tabs tab1={"name": "ES5", "id": 1} | tab3={"name": "ES6", "id": 2} | tab4={"name": "ESNext", "id": 3} %}
{% tab id=1, is_active=true %}
```jsx
module.exports = {

};
```
{% endtab %}
{% tab id=2 %}
```jsx
export default {

}
```
{% endtab %}
{% tab id=3 %}
```jsx
export default {

}
```
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

## Next Steps

It may not look like it, but we now have all the code required to [fetch tweets from the API](../step-2b/).
