# Step 1: Create Production Build

In this step we'll learn how to build the application for production.

> There is no branch for this step because it does not modify any code.

### Webpack
Lore uses [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org) for the build system. If you're new to webpack, you may find
[this video series by Kent Dodds](https://egghead.io/courses/using-webpack-for-production-javascript-applications)
helpful for getting up to speed quickly.

The config file for webpack is located at the root of the project and called `webpack.config.js`. It uses a library
called [webpack-config-utils](https://github.com/kentcdodds/webpack-config-utils) developed by Kent Dodds in order
to allow multiple environment configurations to live within the same config file, such as different configurations
for development and production.

The default config file includes pretty sensible defaults, and is intended to cover the majority of application
development concerns. It includes:

* Support for common CSS preprocessors (LESS and SASS)
* Support for common font types (ttf, otf, eot, woff, woff2)
* Support for common image types (png, jpeg, gif, tiff, bmp, svg)
* Automatically adds browser prefixes to CSS files
* Favicon generation and insertion into the HTML file
* Chunking (breaking the build up into multiple smaller files for faster page load)
* Cache busting (adding a unique hash to production files to prevent browsers from re-using outdated files)

It's entirely possible you may never need to modify the config file. If you do, you can learn
about the [configuration options in the official webpack documentation](https://webpack.js.org/configuration).

### Build the Project
If you open up the `package.json` file you'll see two scripts related to building the project:

```json
"scripts": {
  "build": "npm run clean && webpack --env=production",
  "build:prod": "npm run clean && webpack --env=production -p",
  ...
},
```

Go ahead an execute `npm run build` from the command line. You should see output similar to this once it completes,
which took 15 seconds for this example:

```

```

What that command does is invoke webpack to build your application for production, and places the resulting assets
in the `dist` directory at the root of your project. Here are some key things to callout:

* Lore includes an image located in `assets/images/favicon.png` that is a 1500px png of the Lore logo. This file is used
to generate a number of smaller favicons for different devices. By default, the Webpack config only generates favicons
for the webpack, but you can also modify `webpack.config.js` to generate favicons for devices like Apple, Android and
Windows.
* Source maps are generated by default in the production build, to make debugging production applications easier.
* All images in `assets/images` are copied into the `assets/images` directory in the `dist` folder. This means any
images you add to your project will automatically be available in production.
* Webpack defaults to putting all JavaScript files in a single `bundle.js`, but the default Lore config breaks the
code up into two chunks; one for vendor files, and one for the main application code.
* The gnarly looking file names (like `bundle.main.11e83aeeb2a9a9714d66.js`) include a hash that servers as a cache
busting mechanism to prevent browsers from serving outdated files to users.

Next run `npm run build:prod`. You should see output similar to this once it completes, which took 49 seconds in this
example:

```

The difference between the two commands is whether minification and uglification occur, which can take a significant
amount of time to complete depending on the size of your project. But otherwise the process and generated files are
identical.

The intent of the `npm run build` command is to enable you to quickly generate a production build, and verify it works,
or work out any issues. Then, once everything looks good, you can run the `npm run build:prod` command to minify
and uglify the code for the real and final test before pushing to production.

If you compare the output above between the two commands, you can see that the minification and uglification process
has a significant impact in the size of the final JavaScript files. The `bundle.main.js` file is reduced from *5.17 MB*
to *1.41 MB* and the `bundle.vendor.js` file is reduced from *1.04 MB* to `197 kB`.

That may seem a bit unbalanced (one file clearly has more code than the other), and future versions of Lore may
tweak which files are included by default in which chunks, to balance out the load and future improve page load time.

If you want to experiment with the effect chunk size has on page load time, you can add and remove libraries from
the `vendor` chunk by modifying this section in the `webpack.config.js` file:

```
...
  entry: {
    main: './index.js',
    vendor: [
      'react',
      'react-dom',
      'react-router'
    ]
  },
...
```

### Aside: Serving Production Build Locally
It is often useful to be able to test the production build locally, before deploying it to the remote server. One
simple way to do this is by install the [serve](https://github.com/tj/serve) library, using `npm install -g serve`.

Once it's installed, you can simply run `serve dist --port 3001` and then you can navigate to `localhost:3001` to
view the production version of the application.


### Visual Check-in

If everything went well, your application should still look like this (exactly the same).

## Code Changes

There are no code changes required for this step.


## Next Steps

In the next section we'll [publish the application to the web](../step-2/).
