# Introduction
This quickstart is intended to provide a fast-paced introduction to Lore, to give you a sense of what the framework
feels like and whether it's something you want to invest more time in. Explanations for the opinions expressed in the
framework will be left for elsewhere in the documentation.

        <h4 class="list-group-item-heading">ES5</h4>
        <p class="list-group-item-text">
          I prefer to use <strong>React.createClass</strong>, import code using <strong>require</strong>, and use <strong>none of the syntax introduced in ES6</strong>.</p>
      </button>
      <button id="ES6" class="list-group-item" style="outline: none;">
        <h4 class="list-group-item-heading">ES6</h4>
        <p class="list-group-item-text">
          I prefer to use <strong>classes</strong> with <strong>React.Component</strong>, load modules using <strong>import</strong> and <strong>export</strong>, enjoy using syntax like <strong>const</strong>, <strong>let</strong>, and <strong>default paramters</strong>.
        </p>
      </button>
      <button id="ESNext" class="list-group-item" style="outline: none;">
        <h4 class="list-group-item-heading">ESNext</h4>
        <p class="list-group-item-text">
          I prefer to use <strong>ES6 syntax</strong>, but also want to use next-gen features like <strong>static property types</strong> and <strong>decorators</strong>.
        </p>
