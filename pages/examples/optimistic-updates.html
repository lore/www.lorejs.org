# Optimistic Updates: Example
Lore implements optimistic updating by default, meaning you have to exert effort to _turn if off_. You can see it at
work in [any of the examples in the lore repo](https://github.com/lore/lore/tree/master/examples).

If you have an idea for an example that demonstrates or clarifies optimistic updating in a way not covered by
one of the examples feel free to [create an issue to suggest it](https://github.com/lore/lore/issues)!
