# Infinite Scrolling: Example
There is an infinite scrolling example in the lore repo called [infinite-scrolling](https://github.com/lore/lore/tree/master/examples/infinite-scrolling).
It looks like this:

This example fetches the most starred repositories on GitHub, and allows you to load the next page using
infinite-scrolling. If you load more than 10 pages in 60 seconds, you will see an error letting you know you
hit the GitHub search API rate limit. If that happens, just wait a minute and refresh the page, and you'll load
data again.

### Video Walk-Through
This will be added in the future.
