# Pagination: Example
There is an infinite scrolling example in the lore repo called [infinite-scrolling](https://github.com/lore/lore/tree/master/examples/infinite-scrolling).
It looks like this:

This example fetches the most starred repositories on GitHub, and allows you to jump to specific pages. The pagination
behavior was modeled after Amazon. If you load more than 10 pages in 60 seconds, you will see an error letting you
know you hit the GitHub search API rate limit. If that happens, just wait a minute and refresh the page, and you'll load
data again.

### Video Walk-Through
This will be added in the future.
