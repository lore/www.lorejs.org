# Authorization: Example
There is an auth example in the lore repo called [auth](https://github.com/lore/lore/tree/master/examples/auth).
It looks like this:

<img src="/assets/images/examples/auth-example-login.png" alt="Auth Example: Login">
<img src="/assets/images/examples/auth-example-admin.png" alt="Auth Example: Admin">
<img src="/assets/images/examples/auth-example-user.png" alt="Auth Example: User">

Depending on which user you login as changes what you can do in the application.

### Video Walk-Through
This will be added in the future.
