# WebSockets: Example
There is a WebSockets example in the lore repo called [websockets](https://github.com/lore/lore/tree/master/examples/websockets).

This example allows you to create, edit and delete "todo" items and activity will be reflected across all browser tabs.

### Video Walk-Through
This will be added in the future.
