# Create A New Application

In this step we will be generating our project.

## Video Demonstration
The following video provides a guided walkthrough of this step.

## Written Steps

To create a new Lore app, type `lore new` into the command line followed the by name of your application. For this
example we are going to call our application `lore-tutorial`.

The Lore CLI has a command called `new` that can generate files for a new React project. To use this command you type
`lore new` followed by the name of the your application. Since this is the Lore Tutorial, we're going to call our
project `lore-tutorial`. Enter this command into the command line:

```sh
$ lore new lore-tutorial
```

This will create a new directory called `lore-tutorial`, and place all the necessary files inside. You should see
this message when the task completes.

```sh
  info:  Created a new Lore application `lore-tutorial`
```

### Optional: Create an ES6 and ESNext version of the app

Lore currently defaults to creating a project using ES5 syntax. If you'd prefer to use ES6, you can change the default
by passing in an optional command line argument:

```sh
$ lore new lore-tutorial --es6
```

If you'd prefer to use cutting-room floor features in ESNext (such as decorators and static property types), you can
generate a project using that syntax by passing in `--esnext` like this:

```sh
$ lore new lore-tutorial --esnext
```

In addition to changing the syntax of the initial project files, passing in either of these options will also set the
`language` property in the `.lorerc` file (located at the root of the project) to your preference. This property is
used as a way of declaring your language preference to the CLI, and any future files it generates (using commands we've
cover later) will automatically be created using that syntax. In other words, you'll only have to declare your language
preference once, and the CLI will continue to respect it : )

> NOTE: While the tutorial will allow you to automatically generate files for each step (in case you get stuck or
> don't want to code that step yourself) those files are currently only generating using ES5 as the tutorial is still
> in a little bit of flux. Once it settles down, all tutorial files will be available for generation in ES6 and ESNext
> syntax as well.

### Install Dependencies

Once the project is created, navigate into the directory and install the dependencies.

```sh
$ cd lore-tutorial
$ npm install
```

Depending on your network connection, it might take 2-4 minutes for this step to complete.

## Next Steps

Now that we've created our project and installed the dependencies, let's [start the application](../step-3/) and view
it in a browser!
