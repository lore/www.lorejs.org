# Step 4: Download the API Server
In this step we'll be downloading the API server needed for this tutorial. The tutorial will start off using mock data
as we build the initial experience, but the majority of the tutorial will require a functional API to demonstrate
how the framework addresses handles challenges like authentication, pagination, and filtering.

## Video Demonstration
The following video provides a guided walkthrough of this step.

  </div>
</div>

## Written Steps
Before you can run the API server you'll first need to download it.

### Clone the Repository
To do that, run this command to clone server into your local environment:

```sh
$ git clone git@github.com:lore/lore-tutorial-api.git
```

### Install Dependencies
Next navigate into the directory and install the dependencies:

```sh
$ cd lore-tutorial-api
$ npm install
```


### Start the API Server
To start the API server run this command:

```sh
$ npm start
```

This will start up the server. You can see a list of endpoints by navigating to `http://localhost:1337`:

```js
{
  tweets: "http://localhost:1337/tweets",
  users: "http://localhost:1337/users",
  user: "http://localhost:1337/user"
}
```

### Optional: Change the Port

If you want to change the port the API server runs on, you can do that by using an alternate syntax to start the server.

``` sh
node app.js --port=3001
```

## Next Steps

Next we're going to begin [laying out the application](../../layout/overview/).
