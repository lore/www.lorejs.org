# Step 2: Convert Application Title to Link

Now that we understand a little about react-router, let's use the library to convert the title in our header to a
clickable link that will always navigate the user back to the homepage.

If you're using the CLI to follow along, you can complete this step by running the following command:

```sh
lore generate tutorial step3
```

## Video Demonstration
The following video provides a guided walkthrough of this step.

<div class="video" style="padding-top: 16px;">
  <div class="embed-responsive embed-responsive-16by9 drop-shadow pretty-embed" data-pe-videoid="TUcZ16VGyHQ">
  </div>
</div>

## Written Steps

### Why make the title a link?
Applications can grow to have many nested routes, and sometimes you just need a way to say "take me back to the
homepage please!". You may not have consciously noticed it before, but the majority of applications provide this
"escape" functionality by making the application logo or title in the header a link to the root route (typically `/`).

When designing applications, it's nearly always a good idea to copy user experience patterns your users will already
be familiar with. This makes it easier for them to understand your application, which makes it easier to integrate
into their life.

### Update the Header
To complete this step, open the `Header` component and find this line:

```jsx
<div className="navbar-brand">
  Lore Tutorial
</div>
```

Next import `react-router`, and change the `div` tag to a `Router.Link` tag. Finally, add a `to` property and provide
the root url `/`.

```jsx
var Router = require('react-router');
...
<Router.Link className="navbar-brand" to="/">
  Lore Tutorial
</Router.Link>
```

### Visual Check-in

If everything went well, your application will look exactly the same, but now the title in the header will be a
clickable link that will always take the user back to the root route.

## Code Changes

Below is a list of files modified during this step, as well as a visual diff to show you what was added or removed
between this step and the last one.

### src/components/Header.js

{% tabs tab1={"name": "Diff", "id": 1} | tab2={"name": "Source", "id": 2} %}
{% tab id=1, is_active=true %}
![New Lore App](/assets/images/new-tutorial/diffs/routing/step-2.png)
{% endtab %}
{% tab id=2 %}
```jsx
var React = require('react');
var Router = require('react-router');

module.exports = React.createClass({
  displayName: 'Header',

  render: function () {
    return (
      <nav className="navbar navbar-default navbar-static-top">
        <div className="container">
          <div className="navbar-header">
            <Router.Link className="navbar-brand" to="/">
              Lore Tutorial
            </Router.Link>
          </div>
        </div>
      </nav>
    );
  }
});
```
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

## Next Steps

Next we're going to create a Feed component and [add it to the routes](../step-3/).
