  <h1>Purpose</h1>
  <p>
    There are a lot of demands on front-end applications as they continuously evolve to support the growing needs of
    the user base. Lore's goal is to build support for as many of those common needs into the architecture as possible.
  </p>
  <p>
    This section will describe what Lore does to improve the experience related to:
    <ul>
      <li>the foundational libraries that make up the framework,</li>
      <li>the UI features the framework supports,</li>
      <li>and discussion about the architecture and extensibility of the framework itself.</li>
    </ul>
  </p>

  <h3>Foundation</h3>
  <p>
    The video below provides an overview of how Lore simplifies React development, as well as how it integrates
    support for Webpack, Redux, React-Router and Publishing,

  <h3>Architecture</h3>
  <p>
    This section discusses principles or aspects of Lore that apply to multiple features, or make up the foundation
    of the architecture. This section will be expanded in the future to demonstrate how to extend Lore with your
    own plugins and behavior.
