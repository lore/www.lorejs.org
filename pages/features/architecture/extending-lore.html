# Extending Lore

The majority of Lore is implemented as a collection of overridable hooks, similar to a plugin system. This allows
you to change large chunks of it's behavior without needing to modify the library itself. Instead it can be
modified on a per-project basis. You can do so either by defining hooks within your project itself (by placing
your own hook definitions in a specific location) or by installing a hook through npm install and configure your
`.lorerc` file to use that version of the hook instead.

Things that need to be added here:

* How to create your own hook. Example should include both types of override; placing files in the project
  itself and also by downloading a package from npm and modifying the `.lorerc` file.
* How to create your own generators and extend the CLI
