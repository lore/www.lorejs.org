# Dialogs: Example
There is a Dialogs example in the lore repo called [dialogs-bootstrap](https://github.com/lore/lore/tree/master/examples/dialogs-bootstrap).

> While this example technically demonstrates how to use the `lore.dialogs.show` method and does ineed launch dialogs,
it uses the `lore-hook-dialogs-bootstrap` hook to auto-generate the dialogs. So it may only be half useful if what
you're looking for is also an example of _creating_ dialogs.
> For that reason, I'll strip it down in the future and create a plain `dialogs` example that implements all of the
dialogs explicitly so you can easily view them.

### Video Walk-Through
This will be added in the future.
