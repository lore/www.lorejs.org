# Filtering: Example
There is a filtering example in the lore repo called [dialogs-querying](https://github.com/lore/lore/tree/master/examples/dialogs-querying).
It looks like this:

> This example is overly complicated, and will be replaced with something simpler and more focused the future :) This
> specific example was developed early in Lore's development as a way to test the patterns and behaviors, but is
> still the best example to demonstrate filtering.

The example is focused around creating "Todo Lists", and then each list has a set of todos. When you click on a list,
it loads the todos for that list after making a network request. So it's intended to demonstrate router navigation
where the route changes what data needs to be fetched.

### Video Walk-Through
This will be added in the future.
