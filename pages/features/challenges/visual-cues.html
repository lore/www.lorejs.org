# Visual Cues
Useful for providing the user with a visual indication that some action is being performed but has no yet
completed. Examples include fetching, updating and creating data.

### Visualization
This video demonstrates what visual cues look like. Screenshots are from the _Simply Social_ prototype
that [Invision](https://www.invisionapp.com/) provides you when you sign up for an account.

</div>

### Usage
This section demonstrates how to _use_ the [data structure provided by Lore](/features/foundation/data-structure/) so
please read that first if you're unfamiliar with the data structure.

Data can go through a lot of different states during the lifecycle of an application. Lore calls these states
`PayloadStates`, after the `payload` field in the actions dispatched to the Redux store, and accounts for the following
scenarios by default:

* Data being fetched
* Data being created
* Data being updated
* Data being deleted

It also accounts for error conditions on each of those scenarios:

* Error while fetching data
* Error while creating data
* Error while updating data
* Error while deleting data

And finally it accounts for the scenario where _nothing_ is happening to data, after the transient state has been
resolved. All of these scenarios are represented as constants in a file called `PayloadStates` at
`src/constants/PayloadStates.js` in your project. That file looks like this:

```js
PayloadStates = {
  RESOLVED: 'RESOLVED',

  CREATING: 'CREATING',
  UPDATING: 'UPDATING',
  DELETING: 'DELETING',
  FETCHING: 'FETCHING',

  ERROR_CREATING: 'ERROR_CREATING',
  ERROR_UPDATING: 'ERROR_UPDATING',
  ERROR_DELETING: 'ERROR_DELETING',
  ERROR_FETCHING: 'ERROR_FETCHING'
}
```

When you need to communicate the state of data to your user, you can do it by comparing the `state` property of the
data to one of the payload states and changing what you render according. I'll list the main scenarios below:

<br/>

#### Resolved
This is the _static_ state of data, when it exists and is not being acted upon. An example `post` might look like this:

```js
post = {
  id: 1,
  cid: 'c1',
  state: 'RESOLVED',
  data: {
    id: 1,
    title: 'Cornbread is Yummy'
  },
  error: {}
}
```

The fact that `id` has a value tells us this resource exists on the server. And the `state` is set to `RESOLVED` to
signify that this resource is not being modified or deleted.

You can also think of resolved resources as the default rendering state, like this:

```jsx
React.createClass({
  displayName: 'Post',

  propTypes: {
    post: React.PropTypes.object.isRequired
  },

  render: function() {
    var post = this.props.post;

    return (
      <div key={post.id} className="post">
        {post.data.title}
      </div>
    );
  }
})
```

<br/>

#### Creating
An example `post` for a resource being created might look like this:

```js
post = {
  id: undefined,
  cid: 'c1',
  state: 'CREATING',
  data: {
    title: 'Cornbread is Yummy'
  },
  error: {}
}
```

The `id` is undefined because the resource doesn't exist on the server yet. The `data` field contains whatever
properties were sent to the server. And the `state` is set to `CREATING` to signify that this resource is in the
process of being created.

When rendering a resource being created, it's recommended that you modifying the styling or content of the component
to provide a visual indication of this state to the user. If you're rendering a list of components and need to `key`
to avoid React warnings you can use the `cid` property.

```jsx
React.createClass({

  propTypes: {
    posts: React.PropTypes.object.isRequired
  },

  render: function() {
    var posts = this.props.posts;

    if (posts.state === PayloadStates.CREATING) {
      return (
        <div key={post.cid} className="post creating">
          {post.data.title}
        </div>
      );
    }

    // todo: render RESOLVED state
  }
});
```

<br/>

#### Updating
An example `post` for a resource being updated might look like this:

```js
post = {
  id: 1,
  cid: 'c1',
  state: 'UPDATING',
  data: {
    id: 1,
    title: 'Cornbread is SUPER Yummy'
  },
  error: {}
}
```

The `data` field contains whatever properties were sent to the server, and the `state` is set to `UPDATING` to
signify that this resource is in the process of being updated.

When rendering a resource being updated, it's recommended that you modifying the styling or content of the component
to provide a visual indication of this state to the user.

```jsx
React.createClass({

  propTypes: {
    posts: React.PropTypes.object.isRequired
  },

  render: function() {
    var posts = this.props.posts;

    if (posts.state === PayloadStates.UPDATING) {
      return (
        <div key={post.id} className="post updating">
          {post.data.title}
        </div>
      );
    }

    // todo: render RESOLVED state
  }
});
```

<br/>

#### Deleting
An example `post` for a resource being deleted might look like this:

```js
post = {
  id: 1,
  cid: 'c1',
  state: 'DELETING',
  data: {
    id: 1,
    title: 'Cornbread is Yummy'
  },
  error: {}
}
```

The `state` is set to `DELETING` to signify that this resource is in the process of being deleted.

When rendering a resource being deleting, it's recommended that you modifying the styling or content of the component
to provide a visual indication of this state to the user.

```jsx
React.createClass({

  propTypes: {
    posts: React.PropTypes.object.isRequired
  },

  render: function() {
    var posts = this.props.posts;

    if (posts.state === PayloadStates.DELETING) {
      return (
        <div key={post.id} className="post deleting">
          {post.data.title}
        </div>
      );
    }

    // todo: render RESOLVED state
  }
});
```

<br/>

#### Fetching
An example `post` for a resource being fetched might look like this:

```js
post = {
  id: 1,
  cid: 'c1',
  state: 'FETCHING',
  data: {},
  error: {}
}
```

The `data` field is empty because the server's response is used to populate it, and all we know right now is the `id`
of the resource we want to fetch. The `state` is set to `FETCHING` to signify that this resource is in the process of
being fetched.

When rendering a resource being fetched, it's recommended that you modifying the styling or content of the application
to provide a visual indication of this state to the user.

```jsx
React.createClass({

  propTypes: {
    posts: React.PropTypes.object.isRequired
  },

  render: function() {
    var posts = this.props.posts;

    if (posts.state === PayloadStates.FETCHING) {
      return (
        <div>
          Loading post...
        </div>
      );
    }

    // todo: render RESOLVED state
  }
});
```

<br/>

#### Error Creating
When there is an error creating a resource the data structure might look like this:

```js
post = {
  id: undefined,
  cid: 'c1',
  state: 'ERROR_CREATING',
  data: {
    title: 'Cornbread is Yummy'
  },
  error: {
    statusCode: 409,
    message: 'Title already exists'
  }
}
```

The `state` will be updated to `ERROR_CREATING`, letting us know that we were _trying_ to create this resource but
something went wrong. The `error` field will be populated with whatever error message the server communicates back.

When rendering a resource with an error, it's recommended that you modifying the styling or content of the component
to provide a visual indication of this state to the user.

```jsx
React.creatClass({

  propTypes: {
    posts: React.PropTypes.object.isRequired
  },

  render: function() {
    var posts = this.props.posts;

    if (posts.state === PayloadStates.ERROR_CREATING) {
      return (
        <div key={post.cid} className="post">
          <span className="error">
            {post.error.message}
          </span>
          {post.data.title}
        </div>
      );
    }

    // todo: render RESOLVED state
  }
});
```

<br/>

#### Error Updating

    title: 'Cornbread is SUPER Yummy'
  },
  error: {
    statusCode: 409,
    message: 'Title already exists'
  }
}
```

The `state` will be updated to `ERROR_UPDATING`, letting us know that we were _trying_ to update this resource but
something went wrong. The `error` field will be populated with whatever error message the server communicates back.

When rendering a resource with an error, it's recommended that you modifying the styling or content of the component
to provide a visual indication of this state to the user.

```jsx
React.creatClass({

  propTypes: {
    posts: React.PropTypes.object.isRequired
  },

  render: function() {
    var posts = this.props.posts;

    if (posts.state === PayloadStates.ERROR_UPDATING) {
      return (
        <div key={post.id} className="post">
          <span className="error">
            {post.error.message}
          </span>
          {post.data.title}
        </div>
      );
    }

    // todo: render RESOLVED state
  }
});
```

<br/>

#### Error Deleting

    title: 'Cornbread is SUPER Yummy'
  },
  error: {
    statusCode: 403,
    message: 'Not authorized'
  }
}
```

The `state` will be updated to `ERROR_DELETING`, letting us know that we were _trying_ to delete this resource but
something went wrong. The `error` field will be populated with whatever error message the server communicates back.

When rendering a resource with an error, it's recommended that you modifying the styling or content of the component
to provide a visual indication of this state to the user.

```jsx
React.creatClass({

  propTypes: {
    posts: React.PropTypes.object.isRequired
  },

  render: function() {
    var posts = this.props.posts;

    if (posts.state === PayloadStates.ERROR_DELETING) {
      return (
        <div key={post.id} className="post">
          <span className="error">
            {post.error.message}
          </span>
          {post.data.title}
        </div>
      );
    }

    // todo: render RESOLVED state

  }
}
```

The `state` will be updated to `ERROR_FETCHING`, letting us know that we were _trying_ to fetch this resource but
something went wrong. The `error` field will be populated with whatever error message the server communicates back.

When rendering a resource with an error, it's recommended that you modifying the styling or content of the component
to provide a visual indication of this state to the user.

      return (
        <div className="error">
          Error fetching post :(
        </div>
      );
    }

    // todo: render RESOLVED state
  }
});
```
