# 404 Pages
Useful for providing the user with a clear indication that what they're looking for does not exist, as infinite
loaders and blank pages are both poor user experiences.

### Visualization
This video demonstrates what 404 pages look like. Screenshots are from the <em>Simply Social</em>
prototype that [Invision](https://www.invisionapp.com/) provides you when you sign up for an account.

### Usage
Lore handles 404 errors by treating them as a special case of [Error Handling](/features/challenges/error-handling/).
Normally if you were fetching a `post` with an `id` of 1, and the API returned a 404 status code, the action creator
blueprint would emit an action with a payload that looks like this:

```js
model = {
  id: 1,
  cid: 'c1',
  state: 'ERROR_FETCHING',
  data: {},
  error: {
    statusCode: 404,
    message: 'No Post exists with id of 1'
  }
}
```

But since 404 errors have a clear and explicit use (the resource you asked for does not exist) the default blueprints
treat this as a special case and set the `state` to `NOT_FOUND`. So instead of the generic error message above the
payload will contain this more specific error message:

```js
model = {
  id: 1,
  cid: 'c1',
  state: 'NOT_FOUND',
  data: {},
  error: {
    statusCode: 404,
    message: 'No Post exists with id of 1'
  }
}
```

This in turn allows you to communicate "not found" experiences much easier to a user:

```jsx
React.creatClass({

  propTypes: {
    post: React.PropTypes.object.isRequired
  },

  render: function() {
    var post = this.props.post;

    if (posts.state === PayloadStates.NOT_FOUND) {
      return (
        <div>
          The Post you requested does not exist.
        </div>
      );
    }

    // todo: render RESOLVED state
  }
});
```
