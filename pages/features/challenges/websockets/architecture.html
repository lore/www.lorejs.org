# Architecture
Challenge when implementing WebSockets and architectural approach Lore uses to address it.

### Challenge
The challenge with adding support for WebSockets is finding a way to integrate it into the existing infrastructure
that supports REST API interactions _without_ having to duplicate actions or reducers for every real-time
endpoint (which would be tedious and error prone).

### Implementation
This video describes how Lore will most likely implement support for WebSockets
