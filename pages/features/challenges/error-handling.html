# Error Handling
Useful for informing the user when things don't go as planned and providing them with the ability to correct
the error and try again.

### Visualization
This video demonstrates what error handling looks like. Screenshots are from the _Simply Social_
prototype that [Invision](https://www.invisionapp.com/) provides you when you sign up for an account.

### Usage
As described in [Data Structure](/features/foundation/data-structure/) and [Visual Cues](/features/challenges/visual-cues/)
the default actions in Lore include payload states for `ERROR_FETCHING`, `ERROR_CREATING`, `ERROR_UPDATING` and
`ERROR_DELETING`. There is also an `error` field included in every `model` and `collection` that defaults to an empty object;

```js
model = {
  id: undefined,
  cid: 'c1',
  state: 'CREATING',
  data: {
    title: 'Cornbread is Yummy'
  },
  error: {}
}

collection = {
  state: 'FETCHING',
  data: [],
  query: {
    where: { authorId: '123' }
  },
  meta: {},
  error: {}
}
```

If an action makes a network request to create a model, that request might look like this:

```
POST https://api.myapp.com/posts

{
  title: 'Cornbread is Yummy'
}
```

If that title already exists, and the API has some business rule that won't allow multiple posts with the same title,
it may send back a network request with a 409 status code to indicate there was a conflict, and (hopefully) include
a helpful message about what the specific issue is. Let's say the body of the response looks like this:

```
{
  statusCode: 409,
  message: 'Post already exists with that title'
}
```

The default behavior of Lore's built-in actions is to take _any_ error response (400/500 level status codes) and
embed the body of the response in the `error` field of the payload. So if you tried to create a post like above, and
the server returned the error like above, the `model` would be transformed to look like this:

```js
model = {
  id: undefined,
  cid: 'c1',
  state: 'ERROR_CREATING',
  data: {
    title: 'Cornbread is Yummy'
  },
  error: {
    statusCode: 409,
    message: 'Post already exists with that title'
  }
}
```

And you can access the error from within your components by looking at the `model.error` field like this:

```jsx
React.createClass({

  propTypes: {
    post: React.PropTypes.object.isRequired
  },

  render: function() {
    var post = this.props.post;

    if (posts.state === PayloadStates.ERROR_CREATING) {
      return (
        <div className="error">
          <div>
            An error occurred while creating the post:
          </div>
          <div>
            {post.data.error.message}
          </div>
        </div>
      );
    }

    // todo: render RESOLVED state
  }
});
```
