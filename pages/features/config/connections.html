# config/connections.js

This file is connected to the `lore-hook-connections` hook and overrides the default action behaviors.

## Purpose
Lore is designed with the intention of consuming multiple API endpoints. But since APIs can vary drastically in
terms of their conventions and behavior, there needs to be a way to describe the interface for each API. Lore calls
these descriptions `connections`.

## Example Config File
New projects include a single connection named `default`, and the default config for new projects looks roughly like this:

```js
module.exports = {

  default: {

    apiRoot: 'https://api.example.com',
    pluralize: true,
    casingStyle: 'camel',
    headers: function() {
      return {};
    },

    models: {
      properties: {
        parse: function(attributes) {
          return attributes;
        }
      }
    },

    collections: {
      properties: {
        parse: function(attributes) {
          return attributes;
        }
      }
    }

  }

};
```

The name for the connection (`default`) comes from the name of the key, and the config translates to this statement:

> The API for the default connection is located at `https://api.example.com`. The names of the endpoints follow a
> camelCasing strategy and are pluralized. There are no default headers that need to be sent, and there is no need
> to parse the server response for any endpoints before we consume those resources in the application.

If you were interacting with a second API, such as GitHub's API, then you would create a second config for GitHub like
this:

```js
module.exports = {

  default: {
    // ...config options...
  },

  github: {

    apiRoot: 'https://api.github.com',
    pluralize: true,
    casingStyle: 'camel',

    collections: {
      properties: {
        parse: function(attributes) {
          return attributes.items;
        }
      }
    }

  }

};
```

Once again, the name for the connection (`github`) comes from the name of the key, and the config translates to this
statement:

> The GitHub API is located at `https://api.github.com`. The names of the endpoints follow a camelCasing strategy
> and are pluralized. When making requests to "collection" endpoints (like `/repositories`) the resources we want
> are stored inside the `items` attributes of the response.


## Configuration Options
#### apiRoot
The URL of the API server.

If your API is behind a server route like `/api`, then make sure to include
that in url in the apiRoot, e.g. `https://www.example.com/api`

#### pluralize
Pluralization setting used by the framework when composing API endpoints.

Model names in Lore are singular, but many APIs used a plural convention
when making requests. Use this setting to tell the framework whether it
should convert your model names to a plural form when making API calls.

Here is an example of how this setting would affect the endpoints for
a model named 'book':

```
pluralize | endpoint
---------------------
  true    |  /books
  false   |  /book
```

#### casingStyle
Casing style used by the framework when composing API endpoints.

Since models are camelCased in Lore, the framework assumed the server uses
camelCasing as well. For example, if you have a model called `bookAuthor`,
and pluralization is turned off, `the framework will assume the endpoint is
located at '/bookAuthor'. If the endpoint is something else, like '/book_author'
you will need to tell the framework to modify its convention.

```
casingStyle |  endpoint
---------------------------
  camel     |  /book_author
  kebab     |  /book-author
  pascal    |  /bookAuthor
  snake     |  /BookAuthor
```

#### headers
Headers that should be applied to all network requests. This function will be called before every network request,
and any keys you provide will be added as a header in the network request.

A common use would be sending an authorization token with each request:

#### models
This establishes the default configuration for all `models` that use this connection. You can pass in any options that
are supported by `models`. For a list of options, see the [model documentation](/concepts/models/).

#### collections
This establishes the default configuration for all `collections` that use this connection. You can pass in any options that
are supported by `collections`. For a list of options, see the [collection documentation](/concepts/collections/).
