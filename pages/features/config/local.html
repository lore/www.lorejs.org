# config/local.js

This file allows you to override any of the other config settings in a way that will _only_ affect your development
machine. This file is added to the `.gitignore` by default and will never be checked in.

### Example Configuration
To use this file, simply provide a key named after the file you want to override. So if you wanted to override
the default headers sent to the `default` API connection, so that it always sends a specific JWT token, you just
need to provide a key named `connections` and then describe the config modifications you want to make.

```js
module.exports = {

  connections: {
    default: {
      headers: function() {
        return {
          Authorization: 'JWT super-secret-hard-coded-auth-token'
        }
      }
    }
  }

}
```
