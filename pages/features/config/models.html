# config/models.js

This file is connected to the `lore-hook-models` hook and allows you to map models to connections.

## Purpose
If you're only consuming data from a single API, you'll never need to modify this file. But once you start consuming
data from multiple APIs, you'll need to tell Lore which models are associated with each connection.

## Example Config File
```js
module.exports = {

  defaultConnection: 'default'

  connectionModelMap: {
    default: [],
    v1: [
      'currentUser',
      'author'
    ],
    v2: [
      'book',
      'publisher'
    ]
  }

};
```

## Configuration Options
#### defaultConnection
The default API connection that models should use if they have no explicit mapping.

#### connectionModelMap
If your application interacts with multiple APIs, create a connection for each API and then define which models
are associated with each connection here.

In the example above, the models `currentUser` and `author` use the `v1` connection, while the `book` and `publisher`
models use the `v2` connection. All other models use the `default` connection.
