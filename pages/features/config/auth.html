# config/auth.js

This file is connected to the `lore-hook-auth` hook and overrides the default action behaviors.

## Purpose
This config file let's you control the name of the model, action and reducer used for fetching and storing the
current user.

New projects include a `currentUser` model, and the `lore-hook-auth` hook will generate an action called `currentUser`
that will fetch the user, and a reducer called `currentUser` that will store the result of that action.

## Example Config File
```js
module.exports = {
  modelName: 'currentUser'
  reducerName: 'currentUser'
  actionName: 'currentUser'
};
```

## Configuration Options
#### modelName
The name of the model with a URL property set to the endpoint that can return the current user.

#### reducerName
The name of the reducer that should be created that is responsible for storing the current user. This defaults to
the name of the model.

#### actionName
The name of the action that should be created that is responsible for fetching the current user. This defaults to
the name of the model.
