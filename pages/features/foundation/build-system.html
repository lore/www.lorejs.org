# Build System

> This section is COMPLETELY out of date as of `v0.12`.
>
> `v0.12` replaced Webpack 1 with Webpack 2, hugely simplified the webpack config setup, and introduced a formal
> production build. This page will be updated soon to reflect those changes.

This section documents the parts of Lore that are directly relevant to Webpack. For now that means the development
server and the Webpack configuration.

The video below is an excerpt from the full [Introduction to Lore](/audience/introduction-to-lore/)
video and provides a summary of how Lore helps with Webpack.
