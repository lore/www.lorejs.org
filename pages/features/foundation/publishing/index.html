# Publishing
Lore provides built-in support for publishing your project to two popular platforms; Surge and GitHub Pages.

The video below is an excerpt from the full [Introduction to Lore](/audience/introduction-to-lore/)
video and provides a summary of how Lore helps.

### Feature Comparison
The video below provides a feature comparison of both platforms in order to help you choose between them. Surge
basically includes everything GitHub Pages offers and more (for a small fee) and is also generally easier to
publish to. The advantage of GitHub pages is that it provides a way to view and edit your code without having
to download the files and republish.
