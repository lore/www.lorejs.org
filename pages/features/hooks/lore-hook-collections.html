# lore-hook-collections
Source code for this hook can be found on GitHub [at this link](https://github.com/lore/lore/tree/master/packages/lore-hook-collections).

## Purpose

Iterates through all models in `lore.models` and creates a corresponding Collection for each of them. This is done
so we can fetch collections of resources and not just individual resources.

> This hook isn't meant to be interacted with directly at the moment. While there are things you *could* do with it,
> the use cases for needing to do so are not clear.

## Config

```js
module.exports = {

  /**
   * While this file can influence the behavior of collections, there is currently
   * no clear reason why you would ever need to use it.
   *
   * If you need to define collection specific behavior (such as parsing server responses
   * or defining headers to add to requests) you should do that in 'config/connections.js'.
   *
   * If you have multiple connections, and need to define which collections use each
   * connection, you should do that in 'config/models.js' as this file inherits that
   * behavior.
   *
   */

};
```

### Example Usage

This hook generates the collections that are used by the `find` action to communicate with the API server and retrieve
a list of resources.

For example, given a `tweet` model, and assuming the `apiRoot` for the default `connection` is set to
`https://api.example.com`, the code below will produce an API call to `https://api.example.com/tweets?user=1`

```
var collection = new lore.collections.tweet();

collection.fetch({
  data: {
    user: 1
  }
});
```
