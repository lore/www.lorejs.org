# Hooks
The vast majority of functionality in Lore is implemented as a series of plugins calls hooks. This is done to make
it easier to modify and extend the functionality of the framework.

New projects include a set of default hooks, which you can see if you open up the `index.js` file at the root
of your project:

```js
lore.summon({
  hooks: {
    auth: require('lore-hook-auth'),
    actions: require('lore-hook-actions'),
    bindActions: require('lore-hook-bind-actions'),
    collections: require('lore-hook-collections'),
    connections: require('lore-hook-connections'),
    connect: require('lore-hook-connect'),
    dialog: require('lore-hook-dialog'),
    dialogs: require('lore-hook-dialogs-bootstrap'),
    models: require('lore-hook-models'),
    react: require('lore-hook-react'),
    reducers: require('lore-hook-reducers'),
    redux: _.extend(require('lore-hook-redux'), {
      dependencies: ['reducers', 'auth']
    }),
    router: require('lore-hook-router')
  }
});
```

### List of Default Hooks

* [lore-hook-bind-actions](https://github.com/lore/lore/tree/master/packages/lore-hook-bind-actions): binds all actions to the dispatch method of the Redux store to make them simpler to invoke
* [lore-hook-collections](https://github.com/lore/lore/tree/master/packages/lore-hook-collections): creates a Collection for each model in the application, using information in `connections` config
