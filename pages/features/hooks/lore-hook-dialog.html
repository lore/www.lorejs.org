# lore-hook-dialog
Source code for this hook can be found on GitHub [at this link](https://github.com/lore/lore/tree/master/packages/lore-hook-dialog).

## Purpose

Provide a helper method that knows how to attach dialogs to the DOM. By default it's configured to use the `dialog`
DOM element in `index.html`, but can be configured to use something else.

```html
<div id=`dialog`></div>
```

The helper method is appended to `lore.dialog`.

## Config

```js
module.exports = {

  /**
   * DOM Element ID that the dialogs should be mounted to. Should be located
   * outside the DOM element the application is mounted to.
   */

  // domElementId: 'dialog'

};
```

## Example Usage

Given a dialog called `UpdateTweetDialog`, this hook is used like this:

```js
var tweet = this.props.tweet;

function updateTweet(params) {
  lore.actions.tweet.update(tweet, params);
}

lore.dialog.show(function(){
  return (
    <UpdateTweetDialog
      tweet={tweet}
      onSubmit={updateTweet} />
  );
});
```

The `lore.dialog.show` method makes sure the component gets instantiated and mounted to the correct DOM element. It
also makes sure any dialog previously mounted to that DOM element is removed beforehand.
