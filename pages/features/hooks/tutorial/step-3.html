# Step 3: Specify Dependencies

In this step we're going to specify our hook's dependencies, so we'll have access to the data we need when the
hook loads.

> You can view the finished code for this step by checking out the `step-3` branch.

### Hook Dependencies
While some hooks are completely stand-alone, most hooks don't operate that way, and expect certain data (generated by
other hooks) to be available by the time that hook loads.

An example of a stand-alone hook is `lore-hook-models`, which loads the model config files provided in `src/models`
and converts them all to instances of a Model from the `lore-models` package. Whether this is the first hook that gets
loaded or the last doesn't matter.

The `actions` hook on the other hands expects `lore.models` to exist before it loads, because it needs those Model
classes in order to build the action creators. In other words, the `actions` hook depends on the `models` hook.

The `bindActions` hook is another hook with dependencies, as it's responsibility is to bind every action to the
`dispatch` method of the Redux store. So the `bindActions` hook depends on both the `actions` hook and the `redux`
hook, because it's need the actions to be created first, as well as the Redux store, so that it can perform that
binding.


### Specify Dependencies
Our hook is going to be responsible for creating a container that will invoke an action on a given interval. In order
to do that, we need to make sure the actions are all built (and bound to the Redux store) before we create a polling
wrapper around them. This means our hook has a dependency on the `bindActions` hook.

To specify this dependency, add a reference to the `bindActions` hook in the `dependencies` array like this:

```js
...
  dependencies: ['bindActions'],
...
```

That's it! With the array populated, Lore will figure out which order to load the hooks in based on their dependency
chains, and we are guaranteed that our hook will load only _after_ the actions exist and are bound to the Redux store.

## Next Steps
Next we're going to [make our hook configurable](../step-4/).
