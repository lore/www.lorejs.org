# lore-hook-bind-actions
Source code for this hook can be found on GitHub [at this link](https://github.com/lore/lore/tree/master/packages/lore-hook-bind-actions).

## Purpose

This hook binds all action creators to the dispatch method of the Redux store, to simplify their invocation.

In Lore, invoking action creators is as simple as something like this:

```js
lore.actions.tweet.create({
  text: 'Message to tweet'
});
```

This call invokes the action creator, makes an AJAX calls, and dispatches the result to the Redux Store. But if you
look at the signiture for the `create` action, you may wonder where the `dispatch` argument comes from:

```js
module.exports = function create(params) {
  return function(dispatch) {
    // ...code for the action creator...
  };
};
```

If you read the [Redux docs for bindActionCreators](http://redux.js.org/docs/api/bindActionCreators.html) you'll notice
that action creators are not normally bound to the Redux store. They're "pure" in the sense that they're just a
function with some arguments. The `bindActionCreators` method is what actually takes the `dispatch` method
from the Redux store and binds it to the action creator, so it can dispatch messages to the Store.

This hook iterates through all actions and binds them to the Redux store. This means instead of having to write
code like this all over your application:

```js
import { bindActionCreators } from 'redux'

let createAction = bindActionCreators(lore.actions.tweet.create, lore.store.dispatch);
createAction({
  text: 'Message to tweet'
})
```

You can simply write this:

```js
lore.actions.tweet.create({
  text: 'Message to tweet'
});
```
