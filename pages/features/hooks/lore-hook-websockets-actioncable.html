# lore-hook-websockets-actioncable
Source code for this hook can be found on GitHub [at this link](https://github.com/lore/lore/tree/master/packages/lore-hook-websockets-actioncable).

## Purpose
This hook is built on top of the [lore-websockets](https://github.com/lore/lore/tree/master/packages/lore-websockets)
library and implements the interface for ActionCable.

## Example
See the [websockets example](https://github.com/lore/lore/tree/master/examples/websockets) to see this hook in action.

## Example Usage
The ActionCable hook behaves identical to the SocketIO hook, except for the implementation. The big callout here is the
interface that ActionCable uses, which is a bit different than the other two implementations.

Instead of using `namespaces`, ActionCable uses `channels`. I _think_ they're equivalent, but not sure. Meaning
Socket.io breaks data up into namespaces & rooms, but ActionCable seems to only use one of those (?). I played with
it only enough to get this to work and see if the interface could adapt to something not based in Node : )

``` js
var _ = require('lodash');
var WebSocketConnection = require('lore-websockets').WebSocketConnection;
var ActionCable = require('actioncable');

module.exports = WebSocketConnection.extend({

  // serverUrl: 'http://localhost:1337/cable',
  // channel: 'PostsChannel',

  connect: function () {
    this.cable = ActionCable.createConsumer(this.serverUrl);
  },

  subscribe: function subscribe() {
    var that = this;

    this.cable.subscriptions.create(this.channel, {
      connected: function () {
        console.log('ActionCable:WebSocket - connected!')
      },

      disconnected: function () {
        console.log('ActionCable:WebSocket - disconnected!')
      },

      received: function (data) {
        that.dispatch(data);
      }
    });
  }
});
```
