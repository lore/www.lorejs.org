# lore-hook-auth
Source code for this hook can be found on GitHub [at this link](https://github.com/lore/lore/tree/master/packages/lore-hook-auth).

## Purpose

Generates an action and reducer for handling retrieval and storage of the current user.

## Config

```js
module.exports = {

  /**
   * The name of the model with a URL property set to the endpoint
   * that can return the current user.
   */
  modelName: 'currentUser'

  /**
   * The name of the reducer that should be created that is responsible
   * for storing the current user. This defaults to the name of the
   * model.
   */
  // reducerName: 'currentUser'

  /**
   * The name of the action that should be created at this responsible
   * for fetching the current user. This defaults to the name of the
   * model.
   */
  // actionName: 'currentUser'

};
```

When using this hook you should also modify the dependencies array of the
`redux` hook in `index.js`to make sure it runs _after_ this hook:

```js
// index.js
lore.summon({
  hooks: {
    auth: require('lore-hook-auth'),
    actions: require('lore-hook-actions'),
    bindActions: require('lore-hook-bind-actions'),
    collections: require('lore-hook-collections'),
    connections: require('lore-hook-connections'),
    connect: require('lore-hook-connect'),
    dialog: require('lore-hook-dialog'),
    models: require('lore-hook-models'),
    react: require('lore-hook-react'),
    reducers: require('lore-hook-reducers'),
    redux: _.extend(require('lore-hook-redux'), {
      dependencies: ['reducers', 'auth']
    }),
    router: require('lore-hook-router')
  }
});
```

## Example Usage

Let's say you're building an application that consumes an API that returns information about the current user from
the endpoint `/user`.

In order to retrieve the current user, we need three things in place; a model representing that endpoint, an action
we can invoke the fetch the user, and a reducer to store that user. Unlike the build-in blueprints, this flow is
special in that the action will *always* community with the same endpoint (`/user`) and the reducer will only store
a _single_ object, as opposed to a _set_ of objects like the built-in `find`, `byId` and `byCid` reducers.

To fetch the current user, we then need three files in our project that look like this:

```sh
src
|-actions
  |-currentUser.js
|-models
  |-currentUser.js
|-reducers
  |-currentUser.js
```

This hook prevents you from needing to create the custom `action` and `reducer`. Instead, you only need to create the
model and specify what endpoint the action should fetch the current user from. Here is an example `currentUser` model,
that sets the endpoint to be `/user` (matching out API):

```js
module.exports = {
  endpoint: 'user'
}
```

Once this model exists (and assuming the `modelName` field in the config matches the name of this model) you can
fetch the current user through a `lore.connect` call like this:

```js
lore.connect(function(getState, props) {
  return {
    user: getState('currentUser')
  };
})
```
