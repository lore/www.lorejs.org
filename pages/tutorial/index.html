# Introduction
Whether you've never used React before or are already comfortable developing large applications, this tutorial should
give you a good understand of what Lore is and why a framework can be valuable (allowing you to focus on creating your
components and not building infrastructure for server communication and data storage).

The tutorial tries to make very few assumptions about what you know, and will make every effort to provide links and
explanations for each concept encountered along the way; be it a concept introduced by the framework, or concept that
is central to application development itself.

### What You'll Build
This is the application we'll be building. It is a Twitter-like app, pre-popuated with characters and quotes from
[Chrono Trigger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chrono_Trigger). You can login and logout, create/edit/delete tweets,
and view everyone's tweets or just your own. The application is also real-time, which means you'll be able to see
tweets other people post without having to refresh the page :)

### Concepts Covered
This tutorial is not intended to be quick, but it is intended to be extensive, and by the time you complete it you
should have a good understanding of the types of application concerns and user experience patterns modern application
need to solve for.

You can also rest assured that the time you invest will not to go waste; since Lore is just conventions and patterns
laid on top of React and Redux, everything you learn will be transferable to any React/Redux application you work on,
regardless of whether or not it was built using Lore.

The following concepts will be covered in this tutorial:

* Creating and building a React application
* Layout out your application visuals with mock data
* Routing
* Fetching data from an API server
* Populating your application with real data
* Creating and launching dialogs
* Authentication (login/logout)
* Authorization (restricting actions a user can perform)
* Learning how to create an Infinite Scrolling style experience
* Identifying and solving common React warnings and errors
* Filtering data / performing search
* WebSockets - integrating real-time behavior into your applications


### Future Expansion
In the future, this tutorial will be expanded to cover the following real-world concerns related to publishing
your application:

* Creating a [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/) account
* Deploy the API server to Heroku
* Creating a [Surge](https://surge.sh/) account
* Publishing the UI to Surge
