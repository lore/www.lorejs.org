# Step 4: Parse Server Response

In this step we'll learn about Collections and how to parse our server response to extract the array of tweets.

If you're using the CLI to follow along, you can complete this step by running the following command:

```sh
lore tutorial step11
```

## Video Demonstration
The following video provides a guided walkthrough of this step.

## Written Steps

### Explanation of Error
The reason for this error is that the response coming back from the API server when we make a GET request to `/tweets`
is not an array but an object. The response looks like this:

```js
{
  data: [
    {
      id: 1,
      user: 2,
      text: "Where have they been keeping her!?",
      createdAt: "2016-10-28T04:12:27.566Z"
    }
  ],
  meta: {
    paginate: {
      currentPage: 1,
      nextPage: 2,
      totalCount:51,
      perPage: 5
    }
  }
}
```

If the response was simply an array, there wouldn't be an error, because it would be obvious to Lore where the data
is for the tweets. But in order to provide pagination information, the API wraps the data with an object. So to solve
this issue we just need to tell Lore how to extract the tweets from this object.

### Override the Parse Method
To solve this issue, open up `config/collections.js`. Locate the code for the commented out `parse` method, which
shows the default behavior. It should look like this:

```jsx
...
  properties: {
    parse: function(attributes) {
      return attributes;
    }
  }
...
```

Uncomment the code and replace it with the code below. Instead of returning `attributes` (which is the response we
received from the server) we're going to extract the `data` and return that instead. This will provide the framework
with the array it expects.

```js
...
  properties: {
    parse: function(attributes) {
      return attributes.data;
    }
  }
...
```

### Visual Check-in

If everything went well, your application should now look like this.

## Code Changes

Below is a list of files modified during this step, as well as a visual diff to show you what was added or removed
between this step and the last one.

### config/collections.js

{% tabs tab1={"name": "Diff", "id": 1} | tab2={"name": "Source", "id": 2} %}
{% tab id=1, is_active=true %}
![config](/assets/images/tutorial/diffs/fetching/step-4-config-collections.png)
{% endtab %}
{% tab id=2 %}
```jsx
module.exports = {
  properties: {
    parse: function(attributes) {
      return attributes.data;
    }
  }
}
```
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

## Next Steps

Next we're going to [fetch the user for each tweet](../step-5/).

{% endcapture %}
